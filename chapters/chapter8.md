## Introduction

Social research involves the systematic collection and analysis of data related to the social world. The goal of social research is to develop an understanding of social phenomena, uncover new insights, test theories, assess social interventions, and inform policy decisions. 

Social research serves four primary purposes:

- **Exploratory research** aims to generate new ideas and hypotheses. It focuses on discovering insights and familiarizing researchers with basic details. 
- **Descriptive research** presents a detailed profile of a group, process or relationship. It aims to describe social characteristics, contexts, trends, and changes over time.
- **Explanatory research** goes beyond description to analyze and test theories about causal mechanisms and underlying processes. The goal is to understand why and how social phenomena occur.  
- **Evaluative research** collects data to evaluate a policy, program, or intervention. It assesses whether something is achieving its intended effects and outcomes.

These four purposes shape the methodology and approach taken in a social research project. While projects may incorporate multiple goals, one purpose tends to dominate the research questions, design, data collection, and analysis methods.

## Exploratory Research

Exploratory research is conducted when a problem has not been clearly defined yet. The key goal is to develop preliminary ideas and gather information that will help define the problem and suggest hypotheses. Exploratory research helps determine the best research design, data collection method, and selection of subjects. It often relies on secondary research such as reviewing available literature and data, or qualitative approaches such as informal discussions with consumers, employees, management or competitors, and more formal approaches through in-depth interviews, focus groups, projective methods, case studies or pilot studies.

Exploratory research can involve:

- Reviewing literature and previous research findings related to the problem 
- Interviewing experts on the subject 
- Conducting focus group interviews to explore consumers' insights about the issue
- Conducting in-depth individual interviews 
- Conducting projective techniques like word association, storytelling, third-person techniques, etc.
- Conducting qualitative approaches like case studies on organizations that have faced similar problems before
- Conducting pilot studies to test potential research approaches on a small scale before the main study

The findings from exploratory research are not usually useful for decision-making on their own, but they can provide significant insights into a given situation and lay the foundation for future conclusive research. Exploratory research is flexible and can address research questions of all types (what, why, how). It is a valuable way to gain background information about the research problem and generate hypotheses that can be tested.

## Descriptive Research 

Descriptive research presents a profile of a group or describes a process, mechanism or relationship. It provides basic background information or context on a topic. 

The main goals of descriptive research are to:

- Present a profile of a group, event or situation
- Describe a process, mechanism or relationship  
- Provide background information or context on a topic

Some key methods used in descriptive research include:

- Surveys - Gather data from a sample through questionnaires or interviews
- Observation - Directly observe and record behavior or events 
- Case studies - In-depth analysis of an individual, group or situation

Descriptive research is commonly used for:

- Exploring the characteristics of a group, such as their demographics, attitudes, or behaviors
- Monitoring changes and trends over time  
- Providing an overview of a topic before conducting more in-depth research
- Gathering preliminary data to help design more targeted research studies

Some examples of when descriptive research is applied include market research surveys gathering data on consumer preferences, observational studies of teaching practices in classrooms, or case studies of unique medical conditions. The information gathered through descriptive research serves as a jumping-off point for future research.

## Analytical/Explanatory Research

Analytical or explanatory research goes beyond simple description to model and test theories about the social phenomena under investigation. The goals of analytical research include:

- Testing, refining, or elaborating on existing theories about social processes and relationships.
- Developing new theories to explain observations and make predictions.
- Identifying causal relationships between variables. 
- Gaining a deeper understanding of social mechanisms.

Analytical research utilizes both quantitative methods like surveys, experiments, and statistical analysis as well as qualitative methods like participant observation, in-depth interviews, and focus groups. Analytical research is mostly used in basic, theoretical research rather than applied settings. 

Some examples of analytical research projects include:

- Testing different economic theories by analyzing historical data on inflation, unemployment, and growth rates.
- Conducting lab experiments to understand how social norms influence individual behavior. 
- Developing new theories of gender identity formation based on in-depth interviews.
- Analyzing crime records to test theories about the relationship between poverty and criminal activity.

The goal of analytical research is to move beyond surface description and shed light on the deeper social processes and structures that connect empirical observations. This type of research forms the backbone of building scientific knowledge in the social sciences.

## Evaluative Research

Evaluative research is focused on collecting data to determine the effects or outcomes of a planned change or intervention, like a policy initiative or social program. The main goals of evaluative research are to:

- Assess whether a program or initiative is achieving its intended aims and outcomes. 
- Identify strengths and weaknesses or areas for improvement.
- Determine if a program should continue, be modified, or be discontinued.

Evaluative research utilizes both quantitative methods like surveys, as well as qualitative methods like interviews and focus groups. It can be conducted on a small or large scale. For example, evaluative research could examine the effectiveness of a new crime prevention program implemented in a local housing estate. 

Evaluative research is generally used in applied research settings to evaluate the merit and worth of social programs, policies, or initiatives after they have been implemented. The findings from evaluative research can help policymakers and program administrators determine how to best allocate resources and make improvements. This type of research plays a key role in evidence-based policymaking.

## Social Research As a Scientific Process

Social research involves the systematic collection of data and observations to produce knowledge. It relies on scientific methods and empirical facts, rather than just common sense or personal experience. 

Social research aims to be objective. The goal is to uncover truths about society through rigorous research, even if the findings contradict conventional wisdom or the researcher's own beliefs. The research process and conclusions reached should be unbiased.

Social research is empirical at its core. This means that facts and observations are collected first, through objective research methods. After compiling evidence, the researcher then develops theories and conclusions based on the evidence. The data comes before any interpretation.

The social sciences are sometimes called the "soft sciences" in contrast to fields like physics and chemistry. This is because human societies and behaviors can be more difficult to measure and predict precisely compared to the physical world. But social research still strives to employ scientific rigor and empiricism to develop factual knowledge about the social world.

## Foundations of Social Research

Social research aims to utilize scientific methods, theories and concepts to increase understanding of social processes and problems faced by groups in society. It moves beyond common sense, facts without theory, personal experience or media myths.

### Theory, Not Philosophy or Belief

- Social philosophers often mixed observations, speculations and ideas about how things should be. 
- Modern social researchers focus on how things actually are and why as scientists. 
- Science cannot determine if capitalism is better than socialism - this is left to philosophers.

### Social Regularities 

Social research aims to find patterns of regularity in social life such as social norms.

### Aggregates, Not Individuals

- Social scientists study group motivations more than individuals.
- Research objects are typically aggregates or collections, not individuals.

### Concepts and Variables

- A concept is an abstract idea or general notion. 
- A variable is a set of attributes, e.g. gender has attributes male and female.
- Attributes describe an object like a person - female, Asian, alienated, etc.

The relationship between attributes and variables forms description and explanation in science. For example, describing a class's gender breakdown into percentages of men and women uses the attributes of the gender variable.

## Elements of Social Theory

Social theories are comprised of several key components:

- **Observation** refers to empirical evidence gathered through seeing, hearing, or other senses. Observations are the raw data that theories attempt to explain.
- A **fact** is a phenomenon that has been reliably observed. Facts are discoveries about the empirical world. 
- **Laws** are generalizations about classes of facts that hold universally and are not accidental. Laws summarize regularities in the world but do not explain them. There are no inviolable social science laws like those in physics. 
- A **theory** is a systematic explanation that relates observations to each other and provides an overarching framework for understanding some aspect of the world. Theories arrange facts and laws into a coherent model.
- **Concepts** are the abstract building blocks representing classes of phenomena in a theory's domain. Examples are human rights, social class, etc.
- A **variable** is a concept comprising a set of attributes. Variables allow systematic description and correlation. Class revolution may correlate with the poverty variable.
- **Axioms** are taken-to-be-true statements on which a theory is grounded. Axioms are the assumed starting points for theorizing.
- **Propositions** are logical conclusions about relationships between concepts derived from axioms. E.g. "Humans have an innate moral sense." 
- **Hypotheses** are specific, testable expectations that follow from propositions. E.g. "Humans have moral sense, so peaceful coexistence is possible."

## Theory Construction

There are two primary ways that theories are constructed in social research: deductive and inductive.

<center> <img src="modules\the wheel of reserach.png" alt="The Wheel of Research" width="70%" /> </center>

<br>

### Deductive Theory Construction

Deductive theory construction involves using formal reasoning to derive theoretical expectations that can then be tested through observation and data collection. Researchers start with foundational assumptions or axioms and logically work through propositions and hypotheses. The hypotheses are then tested empirically. 

For example, a researcher might start with the axioms that (1) humans are self-interested and (2) people try to maximize their gains. From these axioms, the researcher could propose that people will seek to minimize their losses in economic transactions. This proposition could lead to a hypothesis that buyers will negotiate for lower prices when making large purchases. The researcher could then design a study to test if this hypothesis holds true in the real world by observing buyer negotiation behavior.

The key aspect of the deductive approach is that theorists use abstract logic and reasoning to move from general principles to specific expectations. These hypotheses are then tested through empirical observation and measurement.

### Inductive Theory Construction 

Alternatively, theory can be built inductively by gathering empirical observations and extracting general principles and explanations. Rather than starting with abstract axioms, inductive researchers gather data and detect patterns, regularities, or correlations in the evidence. They interpret what they observe and build generalized conclusions and theories from the bottom-up.

For example, a researcher might observe that across many studies and contexts, increasing economic inequality in a society correlates with higher political polarization. From these observations, the researcher could inductively generate a theory that inequality causes political factionalism. Further observations could test this theory by gathering new evidence to see if the posited cause-effect relationship consistently appears across time and place.

Inductive theory construction moves from specific empirical facts to broad general principles. It builds theoretical explanations from the ground up. The resulting theories can then be tested deductively by deriving hypotheses and investigating if they hold true.

The key difference between deductive and inductive theory construction is the direction of the reasoning. Deductive theories move from abstract axioms to testable hypotheses. Inductive theories move from tangible observations to generalized explanatory principles. Both are valid scientific methods for developing theories that can advance knowledge.

## Units and Focal Points of Analysis in Social Research

Social research examines various units and focal points of analysis to study social phenomena. These include:

### Individuals

Individual people are a common unit of analysis. Research may look at individuals' characteristics such as gender, age, education level, income, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. It can also examine individuals' attitudes, beliefs, prejudices, and personality traits. 

### Groups
Groups of people who share some commonality are another unit of analysis. Examples are ethnic groups, friendships groups, work groups, families, social classes, etc. Research on groups often looks at interactions between group members.

### Organizations 
Formal organizations like governments, companies, nonprofits, schools etc. are units of analysis. Research on organizations focuses on their policies, procedures, structure, goals, etc.

### Social Artifacts
Objects created by people can be studied, like books, paintings, songs, scientific discoveries, etc. The aim is understanding the cultural significance. 

### Behaviors
Social interactions and actions are also units of analysis. Examples are friendship choices, voting behavior, participation in events, traffic accidents, crime rates, etc. The goal is finding patterns in human behaviors.

### Characteristics
Attributes that can be measured are key focal points. Demographics like age, gender, income, education are commonly studied. Psychological traits like attitudes, personalities, prejudices, and beliefs are also analyzed.

<exercise id="2" title="Research Method in International Relations Study">   


International Relations (IR) is a relatively young field of academic study that emerged in the early 20th century. IR as a discipline is focused on the study of the international system, including relations between states, international institutions, non-state actors like NGOs and MNCs, global issues like climate change, and more. 

IR draws upon various disciplines in the social sciences and humanities, including political science, economics, history, law, sociology, and philosophy. This multidisciplinary lineage means IR utilizes diverse theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches. 

IR scholarship addresses both empirical questions and interpretative questions. Empirical research analyzes events, developments, or trends in world politics using scientific methods and evidence-based analysis. Interpretative research focuses more on understanding meanings, ideas, norms, identities and culture in the international system through critical analysis.

This multiplicity of research agendas has led to debates within IR on appropriate standards of rigor and disciplinary boundaries. Positivists argue IR should utilize the scientific method while post-positivists critique this approach. This essay will examine the empirical-interpretive divide in IR and some of the key debates around theory, epistemology, and methodology that shape the field.

## Empirical–Interpretive Divide

IR scholarship can be grouped into two broad **epistemological traditions** that advance competing claims as to what should be regarded as acceptable knowledge within the field: empiricism and interpretivism. This dichotomy replicates a divide that is evident across the social sciences and coalesces around the question of what knowledge is of disciplinary value and what knowledge should we strive to produce?

Empiricism generally holds that valid evidence of social phenomena should be derived through factual evidence produced via systematic and replicable research governed by established scientific methods. Empiricists promote the application of the scientific method to verify causal relationships and derive generalizable conclusions on the basis of empirical evidence. 

In contrast, interpretivism eschews the notion that the study of society is analogous to the study of nature. Interpretivists argue that researchers cannot identify impenetrable regularities or discover constant conjunctions in human affairs akin to the physical sciences. The focus is more on understanding meanings, motives, reasons and other subjective experiences central to social life yet neglected by empirical techniques wedded to the data derived from observation of the external world.

<br>

## Empiricism/Positivism

Empiricism in international relations aims to **apply research practices from the natural sciences to the study of world politics**. It is based on the broad assumption that **knowledge can be accumulated through objective observation and systematic testing**. Empiricists view international relations as a social science that should be studied in a measurable, replicable, and evidence-based manner. Theories can be generated through careful observation and then tested empirically. According to empiricists, international politics can be studied as an objective reality distinct from the perceptions of the researcher. The validity of theories is judged by their predictive power and ability to produce testable hypotheses. 

Some key scholars associated with empiricism in international relations include Hans Morgenthau, who developed realist theory, and Kenneth Waltz, known for structural realism. Both approached the study of world politics with the intention of constructing testable theories that could explain and predict state behavior and international outcomes. Overall, empiricism remains a dominant epistemology within the field of international relations today.

Empiricism in international relations theory is based on the idea that the study of world politics should emulate the methods used in the natural sciences. There are three core principles that underpin empirical research in IR:

- **IR can be studied as an objective reality distinct from the researcher:** Empiricists believe that international politics exists as an objective reality that is a world 'out there' beyond the researcher's own subjective perceptions. Just as the natural world can be observed impartially, so too can the realm of international relations. The researcher is capable of studying IR in a detached, non-biased manner not influenced by their own values or identity.

- **Theories are held to the standard of predictive validity:** A key test of an empirical IR theory is whether it can predict future events or behaviors. Empiricists develop explanatory and predictive theories that can anticipate how states or other actors will behave under certain conditions. The ability of a theory to accurately predict outcomes is a mark of its explanatory power and empirical validity.

- **Hypotheses must be falsifiable:** In order for a theory to be considered scientific, it must be capable of being proved false. Empiricists propose hypotheses that make clear claims that can be tested systematically against evidence. If the evidence contradicts the hypothesis, then the theory has been falsified and must be rejected or revised. The requirement for falsifiability guards against theories that cannot be disproven.

## Interpretivism/Reflectivism/Post-Positivism

Interpretivism draws upon a rich tradition in IR among scholars whose aim is not necessarily to explain events, developments or trends. Instead, it focuses on understanding the social meanings embedded within international politics. The aim is to unpack the core assumptions that underlie the positivist image of the world in an attempt to counter the perceived empiricist orthodoxy in IR. 

Interpretivist research agendas seek to understand identities, ideas, norms, and culture in international politics. Some examples of interpretivist scholars are Richard Ashley and Robert Cox.

Interpretivism is based on some core principles:

- The distinction between the researcher and the social world, implied by empiricists, should be rejected. The researcher intervenes in, or creates, observed social realities through their own role in knowledge production and thus alters the object under study.

- The researcher and the research subject are mutually constituted through intersubjective understanding, and therefore the object of research does not have its own objective existence outside this mutually constituted relationship.

In summary, interpretivism in IR rejects the assumptions of empiricism and instead focuses on understanding meanings and identities in international politics through interpretive research agendas.

## Empiricism Examples

Empiricism has been a dominant epistemological orientation within the field of International Relations, with many seminal works exemplifying this approach. Key examples include:

- **Hans Morgenthau** - A pioneering realist thinker, Morgenthau advanced a theory of international politics centered on the concept of power. In his classic 1948 work, _Politics Among Nations_, Morgenthau sought to develop testable propositions about state behavior derived from observations about the inherent nature of international politics. His theory of political realism was positivist in orientation, with the aim of creating generalizable knowledge about international relations through empirical study. 
- **Kenneth Waltz** - Waltz's 1979 book _Theory of International Politics_ is considered a seminal text of neorealism. He adopted a structural approach, using empiricist methods of abstraction and logical deduction to create a parsimonious theory that stripped away variables at the domestic and individual level. Waltz tested propositions about the behavior of states operating under international anarchy through observations of great power politics. His theory aspired to offer predictive and falsifiable hypotheses.
- **Neo-liberals** - Scholars such as Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye articulated neoliberal institutionalist theories that recognized the importance of international institutions alongside state power. Their 1989 work _Power and Interdependence_ used quantitative analyses of transnational flows and connections to substantiate their theoretical claims empirically. Neo-liberals adopted scientific methods aimed at developing probabilistic causal claims that could be tested against empirical evidence.

## Interpretivism Examples

Interpretivists in IR draw upon a diverse range of theoretical perspectives and approaches that emphasize the constructed nature of social reality. While united in their skepticism of positivism, interpretivists diverge significantly in their ontological and epistemological foundations.

One prominent interpretivist is the British scholar **Robert W. Cox**, who drew upon the critical theory tradition to develop a neo-Marxist approach for studying global power relations. Cox rejected the possibility of theory-neutral inquiry, arguing instead that theory is always created for someone and for some purpose. His approach emphasizes the intersubjective construction of knowledge and highlights how prevailing power structures limit dissent. 

Similarly, the American theorist **Richard K. Ashley** pioneered post-structuralist analysis in IR, building on post-positivist philosophy to problematize key assumptions in mainstream IR theory. Ashley contends that the sovereign state should not be taken as the natural unit of analysis, but rather critically examined as a discursive construction. His anarchic standpoint rejects the possibility of objective, universal knowledge claims, emphasizing instead the contextual and power-laden nature of knowledge production.

Both Cox and Ashley adopt reflective approaches that seek to problematize and unpack the intersubjective construction of knowledge about international politics. Their research agendas are oriented towards critical theorization rather than empirical testing.

## From Theory to Method: Research Choices

Research is inherently a journey of decision-making. Right from the inception of the research process, students grapple with choices that ultimately shape the nature and direction of their research essay.

When selecting a research topic, students face the critical task of transforming a broad area of interest into a precise, manageable research question. This necessitates a thorough review of existing literature, identifying gaps or uncertainties that warrant further exploration.

The decision-making process extends to the choice of research methodology and theoretical approach. Whether opting for quantitative or qualitative methods, or navigating between positivist and interpretivist epistemologies, students must carefully weigh the implications as these choices define the research design and guide data collection.

As findings emerge, students encounter additional choices in analyzing and interpreting them. These decisions involve selecting appropriate theoretical frameworks, assigning meaning to results, drawing sound conclusions, and pinpointing implications. The challenge lies in presenting the analysis logically and rigorously, aligning it seamlessly with the overarching research aims.

In essence, research is a series of decisions at every juncture. The ability to scrutinize options and articulate justifications is paramount for crafting a coherent, robust, and relevant research essay. Beginning with a well-defined and focused research question lays a sturdy foundation, empowering students to navigate the complexities of research through thoughtful and strategic decision-making.

PHASE 1: DECIDING WHAT TO RESEARCH

- Step 1: formulating a research problem

PHASE 2: PLANNING A RESEARCH STUDY

- Step 2: conceptualizing a research design 
- Step 3: constructing an instrument for data collection
- Step 4: selecting a sample
- Step 5: writing a research proposal

PHASE 3: CONDUCTING A RESEARCH STUDY

- Step 6: collecting data
- Step 7: processing and displaying data
- Step 8: writing a research report

# Phase 1: Deciding What to Research

The first phase of the research process involves deciding what topic or issue you want to study. This phase lays the groundwork for the rest of your research.

The key step in Phase 1 is formulating a research problem. The research problem identifies what you intend to study and is the foundation of your research project. It helps guide all subsequent stages of the research process.

### 1. Formulating a research problem

When formulating a research problem, you need to answer the question - what do I want to research? The research problem should identify the key concepts, issues, relationships or phenomena you intend to investigate.

Some guidelines for formulating an effective research problem:

- Be as specific and clear as possible. A focused, well-defined research problem leads to more effective research.
- Make sure your research problem is researchable given available time, resources, and access to data.Evaluate feasibility.
- Align the research problem with your and your supervisor's knowledge and expertise. This helps ensure you can successfully study this topic.
- Make sure the research problem fills a gap in understanding, knowledge or policy - there should be a purpose.
- Frame the problem as a question or questions to be answered.

# Phase 2: Planning Research Study

Planning a research study is a critical phase that lays the groundwork for conducting the actual research. There are several key steps involved in planning out the study:

### 2. Conceptualizing a research design

The research design provides a framework for collecting and analyzing data to answer the research questions. It specifies the overall approach and methods that will be used, such as qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, experimental, quasi-experimental, correlational, etc. The design outlines the procedures for selecting participants, collecting data, and analyzing results. A well-conceived design ensures the study will effectively address the research problem.

There are several components to conceptualizing an effective research design:

- Identifying the research design type (qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods)
- Determining the study type (descriptive, correlational, experimental, etc)
- Selecting a sampling technique and sample size
- Outlining data collection procedures
- Developing an analysis plan
- Addressing limitations of the design

### 3. Constructing an instrument for data collection

Researchers must decide how they will systematically collect data and then develop the specific instruments to be used. Common data collection methods include surveys/questionnaires, interviews, focus groups, observations, and review of documents and records. Researchers need to determine if they will use existing instruments or develop their own. The instruments should align with the chosen methodology and allow gathering data that can answer the research questions.

Some key points about constructing research instruments:

- The instrument needs to align with the overall research methodology and design. For example, a quantitative study would require a structured questionnaire versus a qualitative study which may use semi-structured interviews.
- The types of information being collected will inform the instrument choice. This includes deciding if the information will be quantitative, qualitative, descriptive, etc.
- Common instruments include questionnaires, interview schedules, observation checklists, and more. These can be researcher-created or standardized/validated instruments.
- Questionnaires and interviews need to be crafted carefully, with easy to understand wording and a logical flow. Questions should gather the data needed to answer the research questions.
- Pilot testing instruments on a small group helps refine and improve them before full implementation. Checking for clarity, length, flow, etc.
- Final instruments should be polished and professional. Clear instructions are provided where needed.
- Enough instruments need to be produced for the entire sample. Reproduction and distribution is planned.

### 4. Selecting a sample

For studies involving surveys or experiments, the researcher must define the target population and determine an appropriate sampling method. Probability sampling provides the best opportunity for results to represent the population. Common probability methods are simple random, systematic, stratified, and cluster sampling. Nonprobability sampling can also be useful for some research goals. The sampling plan outlines the procedures for selecting units from the population to participate in the study.

There are several key factors to consider when selecting a sample:

- Sample size - The sample must be large enough to be statistically significant and allow the researcher to draw meaningful conclusions. Larger sample sizes lead to more accurate results.
- Sampling technique - Researchers can use probability or non-probability sampling. In probability sampling, each member of the population has a known chance of being selected. Common techniques include simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling. Non-probability sampling relies on non-random selection procedures.
- Representativeness - The sample should adequately represent the total population under study across the relevant characteristics, behaviors and traits. This allows findings to be generalized back to the population. Techniques like stratified sampling improve representativeness.
- Accessibility - Researchers must have reasonable access to the sample population. Certain groups may be difficult to access or recruit.
- Feasibility - Factors like cost, time and available resources may limit sample size or techniques. The sample must be feasible within project constraints.

### 5. Writing a research proposal

The proposal explains the purpose and significance of the study, provides background on existing research, and presents the planned design and methods. It gives specifics on how data will be collected, analyzed, and interpreted. The proposal helps communicate the researcher's intentions to stakeholders, guide the investigation, and enable critical feedback. A well-crafted proposal is key for approval to conduct the study.

# Phase 3: Conducting A Research Study

### 6. Collecting data

Once a research design and instruments are ready, the next step is gathering the data. There are various methods for collecting data such as surveys, interviews, observations, and reviewing documents. The researcher needs to follow the sampling and data collection procedures outlined in the research plan. Sufficient data should be gathered to answer the research questions and test hypotheses. Data collection tools should be administered correctly and consistently for reliability. Enough responses need to be obtained for statistical analysis. During data gathering, ethical guidelines regarding confidentiality and informed consent should be followed.

### 7. Processing and displaying data

After collecting the data, it needs to be prepared for analysis. This can involve transcribing interviews, scanning surveys, coding responses, and entering quantitative data into statistical software. The appropriate analytical techniques outlined in the research design should be applied. Quantitative data is analyzed using statistical methods. Qualitative data is examined to identify themes and patterns. The results should be presented clearly using tables, charts, graphs and other visuals. The analysis aims to summarize the key findings, trends and relationships in the data that relate to the research objectives.

### 8. Writing a research report

Finally, the researcher has to communicate the results and conclusions in a research report or paper. This includes summarizing the methodology, reporting statistical analysis, interpreting the findings, stating conclusions, and making recommendations. The results should be presented logically and coherently. Tables and figures can help convey main findings. Limitations of the research methods and potential biases need to be disclosed. The conclusions should tie directly back to the research problem and purpose. Suggestions for practical applications of the research and future studies can be made. The report should have an academic tone and conform to disciplinary writing conventions. Sharing the research findings advances scientific knowledge.

# What is qualitative research?

Qualitative research, commonly called “interpretive research”, is a method that relies heavily on “thick” verbal descriptions of a particular social context being studied. Qualitative research is an inquiry approach in which the inquirer explores a central phenomenon (one key concept), asks participants broad, general questions, collects detailed views of participants in the form of words or images, analyzes and codes the data for description and themes, interprets the meaning of the information drawing on personal reflections and past research, and writes the final report that includes personal biases and a flexible structure.
# The General Characteristics of Qualitative Research

Qualitative research has several defining characteristics:

- **Real-world data sources**: Qualitative researchers gather data from real-world settings, situations, and people. This could involve observations, interviews, documents, etc. directly from the source, not through surveys or remote methods.
- **Descriptive data**: The data collected is descriptive and comprehensive, usually in the form of words, images, audio/video, and other non-numerical formats. This allows for in-depth, nuanced insights.
- **Holistic approach**: Qualitative research emphasizes understanding the whole picture, including processes, relationships, and implications. The focus is not just outputs and outcomes.
- **Inductive analysis**: Qualitative data analysis uses an inductive approach to identify themes, patterns, and concepts that emerge from the data. Researchers do not start with hypotheses to test.
- **Describes participant meanings**: A key goal of qualitative research is to describe the meanings, perceptions, and perspectives of research participants. Findings are reported from their point of view.

# Writing Good Qualitative Research Questions

Questions narrow the purpose of qualitative research. There are two main types of qualitative research questions:

- Central question: The central question is the most general question you could ask about the topic. It establishes the purpose and focus for the entire study. The central question needs to be open-ended, broadly focused, and highlight the central phenomenon being explored.
- Sub-questions: Sub-questions divide the central question into more specific topic areas to investigate. Limit sub-questions to a reasonable number that adequately address the central phenomenon without becoming too narrow or specific.

When writing qualitative research questions, avoid “quantitative terms” such as:

- Comparisons
- Relating variables
- Proving hypotheses
- Measuring variables
- "Relate"
- "Influence"
- "Impact"
- "Effect"
- "Cause"

The goal is to use open-ended questions focused on gathering descriptive data on the central phenomenon from the perspective of research participants.

# Methods of Qualitative Research Design

## Qualitative Study Design

### Data Collection

Data collection involves gathering information to address the research questions. Common qualitative data collection methods include interviews, focus groups, observations, and analysis of documents or artifacts. The researcher may collect data themselves through fieldwork, or utilize existing documents and records relevant to the research topic.

### Data Analysis

Qualitative data analysis involves reviewing the textual data to identify themes, patterns, concepts, insights, and understandings. Common qualitative analysis techniques include coding, categorizing, interpreting, comparing/contrasting, and drawing conclusions. Analysis is inductive and iterative, not following a fixed sequence but rather a back-and-forth process.

### Data Representation

Data representation refers to how the researcher presents the data and communicates the findings. In qualitative research this often takes the form of quotes, excerpts, narratives, and descriptions that convey key themes and meanings. Visuals like matrices and models may also represent relationships between concepts.

### Data Interpretation

Data interpretation involves making sense of the findings and drawing conclusions. The researcher interprets by reflecting on the analyzed data in relation to the research questions, situated within the context of existing theories and literature on the topic.

### Data Validation

Validation in qualitative research establishes the accuracy and credibility of the findings. Strategies may involve member checking, triangulation, providing rich descriptions, clarifying researcher bias, and discrepant evidence analysis.

### Qualitative Tradition

The researcher chooses an approach such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, narrative inquiry, or case study based on the goals and focus of the study. The tradition shapes the methods used in data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

## Example of Qualitative Research Methods

- Narrative research

Narrative research focuses on studying an individual's life story and experiences. The researcher collects data through many forms, like interviews, documents, pictures, etc. This method aims to provide insight into how people make sense of their lives and their perceived reality.

<center> <img src="modules\narrative research.png" alt="narrative research" width="70%" /> </center>

- Phenomenology

Phenomenological research aims to understand and describe the "essence" of a phenomenon from the perspective of those who have experienced it first-hand. Data is collected through in-depth interviews with participants about their lived experiences. The goal is to identify shared meanings and the core of the phenomenon.

<center> <img src="modules\Phenomenology.png" alt="Phenomenology" width="70%" /> </center>

- Ethnography

Ethnography involves studying the shared patterns of behaviors, beliefs, and language within a culture-sharing group. Data collection methods include participant observation, interviews, and artifact analysis. The researcher is immersed in the culture over an extended period.

<center> <img src="modules\Ethnography.png" alt="Ethnograph" width="70%" /> </center>

- Grounded Theory

Grounded theory utilizes data to generate or discover a theory. The researcher analyzes data through coding, memo-writing, and diagramming. Data collection and analysis occur simultaneously, allowing theories to emerge from the data rather than preceding it.

<center> <img src="modules\Grounded Theory.png" alt="Grounded Theory" width="70%" /> </center>

- Case Study

Case studies investigate a contemporary phenomenon in depth and in its real-world context. Data collection involves multiple sources like interviews, documents, observation, etc. The goal is an in-depth understanding of a case or bounded system from various perspectives.

### Considerations for Selecting People/Sites to Study:

There are four key considerations when selecting participants and sites to study in qualitative research:

- **Relevance to the research question** - The people and sites selected should directly relate to the central phenomenon being studied and help the researcher learn more about it. The sample should be purposefully selected.
- **Small sample size** - Qualitative studies typically rely on small sample sizes, unlike quantitative studies. The goal is an in-depth understanding, not statistical power from large samples. Sample sizes are kept small, often under 50 participants.
- **Researcher access** - The researcher needs to be able to gain access to the participants and sites in order to collect data. If certain populations or locations are not accessible, they may need to be excluded from the potential sample.
- **Permissions obtained** - Before collecting any data, the researcher must obtain the necessary permissions from the institutional review board, organizations, and individuals involved. Informed consent is essential in qualitative research.

### Types of information Collected in Qualitative Research

### Observations

- Recording what the researcher sees, hears, and experiences in the research setting.
- May be overt (participants know they are being observed) or covert (without the participants' knowledge).
- Allows researchers to view participants in their natural environment.

### Interviews

- In-depth conversations with research participants.
- May be structured (pre-determined questions), semi-structured (mix of set questions and open discussion), or unstructured (open-ended questions).
- Allows participants to describe detailed personal perspectives.

### Documents

- Materials and records related to the topic, such as policies, minutes, correspondence, journals, media.
- Provide background context and verify findings.

### Audio-Visual Materials

- Photos, videos, or audio recordings documenting the research site and participants.
- Capture detailed, nuanced data that may be missed in observations.

## The Threats to Validity in Qualitative Studies

Qualitative research faces certain validity threats that the researcher must be aware of and mitigate through careful research design and data analysis. The two main threats are observer bias and observer effects.

**Observer bias** refers to invalid information resulting from the perspective or biases the researcher brings to the study and imposes upon it. For example, if a researcher has preconceived assumptions or expectations about the outcomes of the study, they may inadvertently guide participant responses or interpret findings to confirm their assumptions. The researcher must identify their own biases and remain open to unexpected results.

**Observer effects** refer to the impact of the observer's participation on the setting or participants being studied. For instance, participants may feel inclined to give socially desirable responses or censor sharing sensitive information if they perceive the researcher's presence as intrusive. The observer's participation in activities can also alter the natural dynamics of the setting. Strategies like building trust with participants, blending into the research setting, and collecting data over an extended period can help reduce observer effects.

### Strategies to Enhance Validity and to Reduce Bias

To enhance validity and reduce bias in qualitative research, researchers can utilize several strategies:

- Extend the time spent observing the setting to gather more in-depth data over a longer period. The longer period allows the researcher to notice inconsistencies, outliers, and evolving trends.
- Include more participants in the study to make the results more representative of the population. With a larger sample size, outliers and anomalies can be more easily identified.
- Focus on building trust with participants to access more detailed and honest data. Developing rapport helps participants feel comfortable sharing sensitive information.
- Identify personal biases, perspectives, and preferences by reflecting internally and asking for external feedback from others. Seeking out biases allows the researcher to consciously minimize their influence.
- Work with another researcher and compare independent observations and impressions. Having multiple perspectives highlights blindspots and reveals areas of potential bias.
- Offer participants a chance to review verbatims for accuracy after data collection ends. Participant validation helps ensure the data reflects their views and intended meanings.
- Journal reflections, uncertainties, and concerns during the study to examine when analyzing data. Referring to this record helps identify areas where bias could have influenced interpretations.
- Carefully examine unusual results or contradictions for potential explanations. Thoroughly analyzing outliers may reveal meaningful insights rather than mere anomalies.
- Use a variety of data sources to corroborate and confirm findings through triangulation. Comparing data from multiple collection methods highlights inconsistencies and minimizes the impact of biases.

# What is Quantitative Research?

Quantitative research is a type of empirical research that uses numbers and statistics to express its findings. It relies on statistical analyses and numerical measurements of specific aspects of a phenomenon under study. The key characteristic that distinguishes quantitative research from other types of empirical research is its use of numbers and statistical analyses.

In quantitative research, data is collected in the form of numbers and statistics. The quantity, amount, intensity or frequency of something is measured. 

-  Unit of analysis
	- Amounts
	- Frequencies
	- Degrees
	- Values
	- Intensity

Common ways of collecting quantitative data include surveys, polls, questionnaires and **empirical** observations that yield statistical data. The data is then analyzed using statistical techniques in order to reveal patterns, averages, correlations and other statistical relationships between variables.

Quantitative research is based on testing a theory composed of variables that are measured with numbers and analyzed with statistics in order to determine if the theory explains or predicts a phenomenon of interest. The variables used in quantitative research are carefully operationalized to ensure they can be measured, typically on instruments with numeric scales. The purpose of measurement in quantitative research is to be able to generalize findings from a smaller group to a larger population.

Some of the key characteristics of quantitative research include:

- Uses numbers and statistics to express findings
- Involves measurements and amounts of things
- Employs mathematical analysis and statistical inferences
- Tests or verifies theories or hypotheses
- Allows generalizations to be made from a sample to a population
- Uses controlled experiments, surveys and questionnaires
- Uses deductive reasoning to arrive at conclusions
- Seeks precise measurement and quantification of data
- Uses structured and predetermined approaches
- Provides quantifiable predictions and explanations

# Model for Conceptualizing Quantitative Research

- Overall purpose or objective
- Research literature
- Research questions and hypotheses
- Selecting appropriate methods
- Validity and reliability of the data

<center> <img src="modules\quantitative research model.png" alt="quantitative research model" width="70%" /> </center>

<br>

# Purpose of Quantitative Research

### Exploratory

Exploratory quantitative research is a good starting point to get familiarized with some insights and ideas around a topic. For example, exploratory research can help identify key variables that may be involved in a phenomenon, like the dependent and independent variables in a causal relationship. Exploratory research helps set the stage for future research.

### Descriptive

Descriptive quantitative research focuses on "mapping out" the details of a circumstance, situation, event, or population. Descriptive research aims to provide a complete and accurate description by measuring and reporting on the characteristics of variables within a particular sample. For example, a descriptive study could measure average household income in a city to describe the economic landscape.

### Causal

Causal quantitative research seeks to determine cause-and-effect relationships between variables through experimentation and statistical analysis. Causal studies test whether changes in an independent variable actually produce changes in a specified dependent variable. For instance, an experiment could test whether a new educational program (independent variable) improves student test scores (dependent variable). Causal research assesses the impact or objectives of a program or intervention.

# Key Components of Quantitative Research

Quantitative research relies on key components to build a solid foundation before collecting data. These components include:
### Concepts
A concept is an abstract idea that is used to classify or categorize a phenomenon. Concepts help distinguish one phenomenon from another. For example, the concepts of motivation, stress, and depression can be used to classify psychological states.

### Constructs
A construct is the conceptual definition or meaning of a concept. Constructs are theoretical and must be observable or measurable. Constructs link concepts together. For example, the construct of self-esteem may be defined as "an individual's subjective evaluation of their own worth." This links to concepts like self-image, self-perception, confidence, etc.

### Variables
Variables are presented in research questions and hypotheses. A variable is a characteristic or property that varies across people or situations. Variables can be actions, values, attributes, attitudes, beliefs, etc. Independent variables are presumed causes. Dependent variables are presumed effects. For example, income (independent variable) and life satisfaction (dependent variable).

### Operationalization
Operationalization is the process of defining how a variable will be measured or observed in the study. This makes an abstract concept concrete. For example, income level could be operationalized by having participants select a range that matches their annual household income. Operationalization ensures valid, reliable measurement of variables.

# Research Hypotheses for Quantitative Research

Research hypotheses are educated guesses or predictions that the researcher makes about the expected relationships between variables in a study. They are formal statements that clearly describe the expected outcomes of the study.

# Research Questions in Quantitative Research

Research questions are preferred over hypotheses when:

- Little is known about a communication phenomenon
- Previous studies report conflicting results
- The goal is to describe communication phenomena

Research questions are used to describe and explore, while hypotheses predict. With research questions, the researcher is interested in discovering, describing or mapping aspects of a certain phenomenon. The purpose is exploratory and descriptive.

On the other hand, hypotheses propose a relationship between variables and predict an expected outcome. Hypotheses are based on an extensive review of previous research and theory. The purpose of a hypothesis is explanation and prediction.

# Defining and Identifying Variables

## What is a Variable?

A variable is a concept that can be measured. It is a property that takes on different values. A variable is something that varies. A variable is a symbol to which numerals or values are attached. Variables are rational units of analysis that can assume any one of a number of designated sets of values.

The main difference between a concept and a variable is measurability. A variable must be observable or measurable.

<center> <img src="modules\example of concept and variable.png" alt="Concept and variable example" width="70%" /> </center>

<br>

## Types of Variables

There are several ways to categorize the different types of variables:

<center> <img src="modules\types of variable.png" alt="types of variable" width="70%" /> </center>

<br>

### Variables Based on Causal Relationship

- Independent variable: The cause that is responsible for bringing about changes in a phenomenon or situation.
- Dependent variable: The outcome or changes that are brought about by the introduction of an independent variable.
- Extraneous variable: Other factors operating in a real-life situation that may affect changes in the dependent variable.
- Intervening variable: Links the independent and dependent variables. The relationship between an independent and dependent variable cannot be established without the intervention of this variable.

**Example of Variable Based on Causal Relationship**

<center> <img src="modules\example causal relationship.png" alt="example causal relationship" width="70%" /> </center>

<center> <img src="modules\example causal relationship 2.png" alt="example causal relationship" width="70%" /> </center>

<br>

### Variables Based on Study Design

- Active variables: Variables that can be manipulated, changed or controlled.
- Attribute variables: Variables that cannot be manipulated, changed or controlled, and reflect characteristics of the study population (e.g. age, gender).

### Variables Based on Unit of Measurement

- Constant variable: Has only one category or value (e.g. taxi, tree, water).
- Dichotomous variable: Has only two categories (e.g. yes/no, male/female).
- Polytomous variable: Can be divided into more than two categories (e.g. religion, political parties, attitudes).

# Validity of Quantitative Research


Validity refers to how well a test measures what it claims to measure. It is vital for a research study to be valid in order for the results to be accurately applied and interpreted. There are four main types of validity to consider in quantitative research:

## Construct Validity

Construct validity examines whether the measures used are actually measuring what they are intended to measure. It looks at whether the operational definition of a variable accurately reflects its theoretical meaning. Strong construct validity means the variable is defined and measured correctly in relation to the concepts being studied.

## Internal Validity

Internal validity examines whether changes in the dependent variable are actually caused by changes in the independent variable, rather than being caused by confounding variables. It questions if there is a causal relationship between the independent and dependent variables. High internal validity allows the researcher to make definitive statements about cause-and-effect relationships.

## External Validity

External validity considers whether results can be generalized beyond the specific study to wider populations, settings, time periods, and measures. It questions if findings are externally valid and applicable to other contexts. High external validity allows the results to be applicable in a wide variety of contexts.

## Statistical Validity

Statistical validity examines the appropriateness of statistical tests used, accuracy of analysis, and statistical power of the study. It looks at whether enough data is collected to support statistically valid conclusions. High statistical validity means appropriate tests are used and there is enough statistical power to avoid errors.

<exercise id="6" title="Research Question">   

# The Importance of the Research Question

The research question is the fundamental core of a research project. It serves as the foundation on which the entire study is constructed. A clearly defined research question guides the researcher in multiple aspects of the study including determining the research design, methodology, data collection procedures, and analysis techniques.

The research question identifies the primary aim and objectives that the study intends to address. It delineates the scope and provides direction for all stages of the research process. A well-formulated research question allows the researcher to determine the type of data needed, the approach to data collection, and how the information will be analyzed. It enables the researcher to stay focused on the main goals of the project throughout its duration.

A well-crafted research question:

- Defines the purpose and focus of the research project
- Guides the research methodology and data collection
- Helps determine the scope of research and resources required
- Provides direction for data analysis
- Structures the final research report

In essence, the research question is the compass that steers the research ship towards its destination. It keeps the study on course and prevents deviation into tangential issues. All parts of the research plan from literature review to data interpretation should tie back directly to the central research question. A clear, concise, and thoughtful research question sets the stage for a successful research endeavor.

# Research Question vs. Thesis Statement

A research question and thesis statement have fundamental differences:

- A research question asks about a problem or issue to explore. It identifies the purpose and goals for a research project. The question lays the foundation for the research by guiding the methodology and data collection.
- A thesis statement, on the other hand, makes an argument and directly answers the research question. It is a concise statement that summarizes the central argument or claim of the paper. The thesis provides the direction and focus for the entire work.
- In short, the research question asks what needs to be studied, while the thesis statement answers the research question with an argument and analysis. The research question comes before and helps develop the thesis statement.
- For example, the research question may ask "Why did comics become darker in the 1980s?" After conducting research, the thesis statement would answer with an argument like "Comics became darker and more violent in the 1980s as writers expressed the cultural anxieties of the Reagan era." The thesis makes a specific claim supported by evidence to answer the broader research inquiry.
- A research question guides the research process, while a thesis statement presents the conclusion of that research. The research question lays the foundation, while the thesis statement builds the house.

# Good Research Question

A good research question should:

- Be clearly linked to the overall research project goal. The question should directly relate to the purpose and aims of the research. If the research aims to explore a certain phenomenon, the question should address that phenomenon.
- Allow the target population to be identified. The question should indicate the specific group or subject to be studied. This helps determine the data sources needed and scope of the research.
- Guide the appropriate data collection method and analysis. The question gives direction on how to obtain the relevant data and the type of analysis required. It influences decisions about the research design, such as whether interviews, surveys, or experiments are needed.
- Identify the outcome variables and key predictors. The question points to the key factors and relationships to be measured and examined. This shapes how data is collected and analyzed.
- Determine the scope and sample size needed. The specificity of the question indicates the breadth of data required and appropriate number of study participants. Broader questions require larger samples.
- Raise additional questions about methodology. The question prompts thinking about the optimal ways to gather data and conduct the investigation. This guides choices made about specific research methods and tools.


# Choosing Topics Appropriate to International Relations Research

## Research Topics in International Relations - Overview

International Relations (IR) is a diverse field that examines relationships between countries, interactions between governments, the role of international organizations, and the political dynamics between state and non-state actors. Some of the key topics examined in IR research include:

- International security - Issues related to war, conflict, arms control, terrorism, etc.
- International political economy - Trade, development, monetary policy, globalization, multinational corporations, etc.
- Theories of power - Realism, liberalism, constructivism, Marxism, etc.
- Foreign policy - How countries conduct diplomacy and make foreign policy decisions.
- International conflict - Causes, escalation, management, and resolution of conflicts.
- Military force - Strategic studies, nuclear weapons, asymmetric warfare.
- Trade - Barriers, agreements, organizations like WTO, effects on development.
- International organizations - United Nations, regional bodies, treaty regimes, non-governmental organizations.
- International law - Laws governing state behavior, human rights, the environment, outer space, etc.
- International development - Aid, sustainability, poverty reduction, microfinance, etc.
- North-South relations - Interactions between developed and developing countries.

## Example of The Differences Topics in Descriptive and Research Paper

<br>

# Writing an Initial Subtopic Question

The initial question is needed to guide preliminary, foundation-building research. Question-based research papers seek to unravel the puzzles associated with not readily apparent cause-and-effect relationships. When writing the initial research question, keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Focus the question - Make sure the question is specific enough to guide focused research but not so narrow that you won't find enough information.
- Avoid simple process/description questions - Don't ask questions that would result in projects that simply describe a process, an event, or terminology. For example "How do global markets operate?" or "What is comparative advantage?".
- Ask a why or how question - Asking why or how something occurred leads to uncovering cause-and-effect relationships which make for more insightful research. For example "Why do states use trade barriers?" or "How do global markets benefit developing countries?".
- Consider scope - Make sure the scope of the question is reasonable for the length of the intended research paper. Don't take on questions better suited for a dissertation if you are writing a class paper.
- Point towards analysis - Choose a question that requires analytical thinking to answer rather than just gathering descriptive information.
- Spark your interest - Pick a research question you are genuinely curious about and interested in studying further. Your passion will show in the final paper.

# Scholarly Literature and the Literature Review

## Scholarly Literature

Scholarly literature refers to research that is published in academic journals and books by experts in a particular field. It is different from more popular sources like newspapers, magazines, websites, and encyclopedias in several key ways:

- **Purpose**: Scholarly literature aims to present new research, theories, methodologies, interpretations, or arguments to advance knowledge in a field. Popular sources provide general information for a broad audience.
- **Authors**: Scholarly literature is written by scholars and researchers who are actively contributing new knowledge in their field. Popular sources may incorporate scholarly findings, but are not written by the original researchers.
- **Audience**: Scholarly literature is aimed at other experts in the field. The writing assumes the reader has background knowledge and uses field-specific terminology. Popular sources target the general public.
- **Editorial process**: Scholarly publications undergo extensive peer-review before being accepted for publication. This review verifies the validity, originality, and importance of the research. Popular sources do not have a comparable peer-review process.
- **References**: Scholarly works always cite their sources and influences. References allow the reader to trace the evidence that leads to the author's conclusions. Popular sources may include occasional references.
- **Systematic methodology**: Scholarly research follows well-defined protocols and rigorous methodologies designed to add reliable new findings to the knowledge base of the field. Popular writing does not produce new knowledge in this way.

The major types of scholarly literature include:

- **Journal articles**: Report on original research and experiments. The most prestigious journals rigorously peer-review submissions to uphold standards.
- **Scholarly books**: In-depth studies on a topic that integrate the latest research findings. Academic presses oversee scholarly book publication.
- **Edited books**: Anthologies of separately authored chapters focused on a theme or issue. Edited by experts who provide commentary.
- **Conference papers**: Preliminary research presented at academic conferences and symposia before being revised for journal or book publication.

Scholarly literature provides the theoretical background and research-based evidence needed to design rigorous studies and advance knowledge in a field. It is a foundational component of quality research across disciplines.

## The Importance of Scholarly Literature

Scholarly literature serves some key functions in the research process. Most importantly, reviewing prior scholarly work helps refine research questions and identify potential variables and hypotheses. The research questions drive the entire research project, so it's critical to harness the knowledge in existing literature to develop thoughtful and focused research questions.

Additionally, the literature review establishes important connections between the proposed research and previous studies in the field. By thoroughly reviewing relevant scholarly work, researchers can show how their study fits into the existing body of knowledge. The literature review provides crucial background context and demonstrates how the new study expands on or departs from what has already been studied. In this way, the literature review helps to position new research studies in relation to prior knowledge.

Overall, a strong review of scholarly literature brings clarity and direction to a research project. It enables researchers to leverage the insights and findings of previous studies to craft novel, relevant research questions that can advance knowledge in the field. The literature review is thus a vital stepping stone in developing impactful research.

## Types of Scholarly Literature

### Scholarly Journals
Scholarly journals, also known as academic or peer-reviewed journals, are periodicals that publish original research articles written by experts in a specific discipline. The articles are written by scholars for other scholars. These journals go through a rigorous peer-review process, where other experts in the field review the articles before they are accepted for publication. This helps ensure the articles meet the journal's standards for quality research. Examples of scholarly journals in international relations include International Organization, International Studies Quarterly, and Foreign Affairs.

### Peer-Reviewed Books
Peer-reviewed books are scholarly books whose manuscripts have gone through review by other experts before being accepted for publication. University presses often publish peer-reviewed books. The peer-review process helps ensure the accuracy and quality of the research and writing. Examples of university presses that publish peer-reviewed books in international relations include Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, and Princeton University Press.

### Edited Books
Edited books contain chapters written by different authors on a central theme. The book editor solicits chapters from experts and coordinates the book's production. Edited books allow examination of a topic from diverse scholarly perspectives. Examples of edited books in international relations include Globalization and the Nation State and Critical Perspectives on the Responsibility to Protect.

### Electronic Sources
There are some high-quality scholarly electronic sources. These include scholarly articles available through academic databases like JSTOR and academic research repositories like SSRN. However, when evaluating electronic sources it's important to assess their credibility, accuracy, reputation, and currency. High-quality scholarly sources will provide citations and references. Examples of reputable scholarly blogs in international relations include Duck of Minerva and War on the Rocks.

## How to determine whether an online article comes from a scholarly journal

When reviewing online articles and sources, there are several indicators to look for to determine if the source comes from a credible, scholarly publication:

### Level of Detail
Scholarly sources will provide in-depth details, descriptions, and discussions of the topic at hand. They should demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the subject rather than superficial summations.

### Technical Language
Scholarly publications utilize discipline-specific terminology and language conventions suited for an academic audience. The writing style and vocabulary will differ from more mainstream publications.

### Explanation of Methodology
Reputable scholarly articles will describe in detail the research methods, data collection, and analytical processes used by the authors. This allows readers to evaluate the rigor and validity of the study.

### Citations
Scholarly publications rely heavily on citations to reference existing literature, studies, data sources, and other evidentiary materials. Citations and references will be provided as footnotes, endnotes, or a bibliography.

### Credible Authors
The authors of scholarly publications will have academic credentials and expertise related to the research topic. Information about their background is typically provided.

### Peer Review
Scholarly journals utilize a peer review process where submissions are evaluated by expert reviewers to assess methodology, accuracy, and contribution to the field. Articles accepted have passed this rigorous vetting.

# Reviewing the Literature

## The Place of the Literature Review in Research

The literature review provides important background for a research study. It establishes the links between the study being proposed and previous work that has already been done in the area. A good literature review shows how the findings of the study contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the field. It also helps integrate the new research findings into what is already known.

The literature review helps bring clarity and focus to a research problem. By reviewing previous studies, the researcher learns what aspects of the topic have already been examined, what has been found, what gaps exist, and what suggestions have been made for further research. This helps the researcher focus their own study on areas where more information is needed.

Reviewing previous literature also allows the researcher to improve their research method. The literature review reveals procedures, methods, and problems encountered in prior studies. This allows the researcher to select methods most likely to provide valid answers to the research questions.

Additionally, the literature review expands the researcher's knowledge of the field and topic area. It is important to understand what other researchers have already found regarding similar questions and topics. This context helps the researcher see how their own findings fit into the existing knowledge base.

## The Function of Literature Review in Our Own Study
 
- When reviewing the literature we learn what aspects of our subject area have been examined by others, what they have found out about these aspects, what gaps they have identified and what suggestions they have made for further research.
- Help us to focus our study on areas where there are gaps in the existing body of knowledge, thereby enhancing its relevance.
- A literature review tells you if others have used procedures and methods similar to the ones that you are proposing, which procedures and methods have worked well for them and what problems they have faced with them.
- By becoming aware of any problems and pitfalls, you will be better positioned to select a method that is capable of providing valid answers to your research question.
- It is important that you know what other researchers have found in regard to the same or similar questions, what theories have been put forward and what gaps exist in the relevant body of knowledge.
- Another important reason for doing a literature review is that it helps you to understand how the findings of your study fit into the existing body of knowledge

## Literature search and review on your topic

- Literature search and review on your topic
	- What are the key theories, concepts and ideas?
	- What are the epistemological and ontological grounds for the discipline?
	- What are the main questions and problems that have been addressed to date?
	- How is knowledge on the topic structured and organised?
	- What are the origins and definitions of the topic? 
	- What are the political standpoints?
	- What are the major issues and debates about the topic? 
	- What are the key sources?

# How to Review the Literature

## Four Steps Involved in Conducting a Literature Review
 
- Searching for the existing literature in your area of study

The first step is to search for existing literature related to your research area or topic. This involves identifying appropriate databases, journals, reference works, and other potential sources of information. It's important to use effective search strategies, including identifying key search terms, Boolean operators, and relevant subject headings. Cast a wide net initially before narrowing your search criteria.

- Reviewing the selected literature.

Once you've gathered a set of potentially relevant sources, the next step is to review them thoroughly. As you review each source, consider the theories presented, methodologies used, findings reported, limitations noted, and conclusions drawn. Take detailed notes and begin identifying themes and important issues that recur across sources. Look for areas of agreement and disagreement within the existing literature.

- Developing a theoretical framework.

Based on your review of the literature, begin articulating the key theories, models, and conceptual frameworks that have informed research in your topic area. Synthesize this information to create a theoretical framework for your own study, showing how it fits into and builds upon existing knowledge.

- Developing a conceptual framework

Finally, develop a conceptual framework that connects the variables and concepts you'll be examining in your study to the broader theoretical framework. Determine the specific relationships between variables you'll investigate and the indicators you'll use to operationally define and measure those variables. Your conceptual framework provides a roadmap for your empirical research.

## Reviewing the Selected Literature
 
When reviewing the literature, it is important to note whether the knowledge relevant to your theoretical framework has been confirmed beyond doubt. Examine the theories put forward, any criticisms of these theories and their basis, the methodologies adopted in prior research (such as study design, sample size and characteristics, measurement procedures, etc.), and any criticisms of the methodologies.

Evaluate to what extent the findings from existing research can be generalized to other situations. Notice where there are significant differences of opinion among researchers and assess the validity of these differences. Ascertain the areas in which little or nothing is known – the gaps that exist in the current body of knowledge. This will help identify opportunities for your own research to fill in some of these gaps.

## Developing a Theoretical Framework

Literature pertinent to your study may deal with two types of information:

1. Universal
2. Specific (i.e. local trends or a specific program)

In writing about such information you should start with the general information, gradually narrowing it down to the specific.

Whereas the theoretical framework consists of the theories or issues in which your study is embedded, the conceptual framework describes the aspects you selected from the theoretical framework to become the basis of your enquiry.

The conceptual framework is focused on indicators to measure the research study.

## Major Concerns

When conducting a literature review, there are some key best practices to keep in mind:

### Using the Right Keywords

- Identify the key terms that describe your research topic, question, and scope. These will be critical for searching databases and catalogs effectively.
- Consider synonyms, alternate spellings, and related concepts. Cast a wide initial net.
- Refine keywords as the search evolves and you determine which terms yield the most relevant results.

### Narrowing the Search

- Use filters available in search tools and databases to narrow results by date, methodology, peer review status, etc.
- Identify seminal studies and theoretical frameworks most relevant to your question. Then search citations and works that cite those sources.
- As themes and gaps emerge, search for studies that relate specifically to those areas.

**Example way of searching**

<br>

### Using the Library Effectively

- Work with librarians to understand advanced search techniques for databases and tools specific to your field.
- Use interlibrary loan services to access hard-to-find resources.
- Evaluate not just abstracts but full studies to determine relevance and quality.
- Organize sources and notes systematically from the start. Tracking key information will save time later.

<exercise id="8" title="IR Research Method: Participant Observation and Focus Group">   

# Observation

## What is Observation?

Observation is a systematic method of watching, recording, analyzing and interpreting people's behavior, events, or phenomena in their natural setting. The observer does not interact or intervene in what is being observed, but simply watches without influencing the situation or outcomes.

Key aspects of observation as a scientific research method include:

- Used to collect primary data about behavior and events in natural settings
- Involves looking and listening carefully and systematically
- Recording what is observed through field notes, audio/video, photographs etc.
- Observing actual behavior versus self-reported behavior
- Non-interference from the observer
- Participants may be unaware they are being observed
- Allows studying of individuals and groups
- Can investigate subtle or complex behaviors or interactions
- Useful for exploratory and inductive research
- Provides contextual, descriptive data

The goal of observation research is to generate insights into behaviors, relationships, patterns, and the contexts in which they occur, by watching people and events unfold naturally.

# Why Observe?

- Observation allows the researcher to study people in their 'natural setting' without their behavior being influenced by the presence of a researcher.
- Observational data usually consists of detailed information about particular groups or situations. This kind of data can 'fill out' and provide a deeper, richer, understanding than survey work which tends to produce less detailed information about a larger number of people.
- Some methods only allow for the study of one individual at a time. Observation enables the research to study groups of people together, that is, it allows for the study of interaction between the members of a group.

# Types of Observation

- Participant Observation

Participant observation involves the researcher directly participating in the activities of the group being studied. The researcher becomes an active member in the culture or context being observed in order to gain greater insight and understanding.

- Non-participant Observation

In non-participant observation, the researcher remains separate from the group under study and does not actively participate in their activities. The researcher observes from an outsider's perspective without direct involvement with the participants.

- Direct Observation

In direct observation, the researcher directly watches and records the behaviors and actions of individuals or groups in real-time. This allows for data collection as the events and behaviors unfold, without relying on after-the-fact recollections or perceptions.

- Indirect Observation

Indirect observations are observations in which the researcher uses existing records instead of making first-hand observations. The researcher does not collect data in real-time but relies on past recordings and documentation for the data.

- Controlled Observation

In controlled observation, the researcher manipulates the environment and controls the factors that are allowed to influence the variables under study. This is done so that extraneous or confounding variables can be controlled and not influence the variables under observation.

- Uncontrolled Observation

Uncontrolled observation occurs when the researcher does not manipulate or control the situation that is being observed. The researcher merely observes behavior, events, phenomena, etc. as they naturally occur in real-world settings. There are no controls introduced or manipulation of variables by the researcher.

# Focus Group

## What is a Focus Group?

A focus group is a small group discussion guided by a facilitator. The facilitator asks questions to elicit perspectives from the participants on the topic being studied.

Focus groups typically consist of 6 to 10 participants who share similar characteristics relevant to the topic. The facilitator uses a discussion guide to lead the group through the questions, allowing the conversation to flow naturally.

The main advantage of focus groups is the opportunity to gather in-depth insights through group discussion. Participants can share ideas and perspectives that may not emerge in individual interviews. The group dynamic often sparks new thoughts as participants hear others' comments.

Focus groups serve various research purposes, including:

- Gaining background information or context on a topic
- Generating research hypotheses based on participants' attitudes and beliefs
- Evaluating reactions to an idea, event or proposal
- Interpreting previously obtained quantitative results through qualitative insights

# Why/When Might You Use Them?

- When you want to generate discussion/debate about your research question/ area of research, but you do not think that individual responses will yield the kinds of data you want.
- When you think that individuals may not be able to provide adequate responses on your research question.
- When people may not feel ‘safe’ talking in individual interviews.
- Other reasons are the same as all qualitative methods (lack of research in area, wanting to develop theory,  wanting to develop a quantitative stage of study, etc.)

# Basic Use of Focus Group

- Problem identification
- Planning
- Implementation
- Assessment

# Types of Research Data Collection Techniques

Qualitative and quantitative methods are the two main approaches to conducting research. Qualitative research explores attitudes, behaviors, and experiences through methods like interviews and focus groups. It attempts to get an in-depth understanding of a problem. Quantitative research gathers numerical data and generalizes it across groups. It seeks to establish statistical relationships between variables.

Two common qualitative research methods are interviews and surveys. Interviews involve having conversations with research participants to explore their perspectives on a program or topic. Surveys gather self-reported data from research participants through a standardized set of questions. 

# Interview as Qualitative Research Method

## What is Interview?

An interview is a qualitative research method that involves verbally asking questions and hearing the responses from the interviewee. There are several formats interviews can take:

- **Structured Interview**: The interviewer asks a predetermined set of questions in a set order. There is no deviation from the script.
- **Semi-Structured Interview**: The interviewer has preset questions to ask, but can change the order and wording of questions as needed. Questions can also be omitted or added spontaneously during the interview.
- **Unstructured Interview**: The interviewer has a general topic but allows the conversation to flow naturally, with questions emerging from the dialogue.

Interviews can take place in person, over the phone, one-on-one, or in a group setting. The interviewer records the responses from the interviewee(s) to gather qualitative data.

## When it is Useful?

Interviews are a great qualitative research method when you want to deeply understand an individual's perspective and experience. Here are some of the key reasons interviews are useful:

- **Hear the respondent's voice and perspective**: Interviews allow you to hear the participant's authentic voice and perspective in their own words. This provides rich qualitative data directly from the source.
- **Delve into depth on a topic or experience**: Interviews are ideal for digging deeper into a topic or experience. The back-and-forth nature allows the interviewer to probe with follow-up questions and gain more detailed insights.
- **Personal interaction**: Interviews involve personal interaction between the interviewer and respondent. This can help build rapport and make the respondent feel more comfortable sharing information.
- **Reading/writing skills are limited**: Interviews are helpful when working with populations who may have limited literacy or difficulty with reading/writing extensive information. The verbal nature makes participation more accessible.

## Advantages of Interview

Interviews allow for deep, free responses from participants. Unlike surveys with limited answer choices, interviews let participants explain their thoughts, feelings, and experiences in detail, in their own words. The interviewer has the flexibility to adapt questions based on the responses and flow of the conversation.

Interviews also allow the interviewer to observe tone, gestures, and body language that elucidate the verbal response. Seeing facial expressions and posture provides contextual clues to better understand the meaning behind the words.

Additionally, the interviewer can probe for more information, clarify any confusion, and ask follow-up questions to get fuller, richer responses. By having a dialogue rather than just asking a set of questions, the interviewer can ensure thorough understanding and explore interesting tangents that arise.

## Disadvantages of Interview

- Interviews are time-consuming and costly. Each interview requires scheduling time with the respondent, conducting the interview itself, and then analyzing the results. For large sample sizes, this process becomes impractical.
- Interviews are impractical for collecting data from large numbers of people. The one-on-one nature makes it difficult to reach a large sample.
- Interviews require skilled interviewers to build rapport, ask good questions, and probe for deeper insights. Not all researchers have these specialized skills.
- It can be challenging to summarize and make sense of many different interview responses. Unlike quantitative data, the qualitative data from interviews is harder to analyze.
- Possible biases can influence the interview process, including biases from the interviewer, the respondent, and the interview situation itself. The interaction is not as standardized and anonymous as a survey.

# Survey as Research Method

A survey is a research method used to collect data from a sample of people by asking them structured questions and recording their responses. The researcher selects a sample of respondents that is representative of some larger population. The researcher then administers a standardized questionnaire to the sample to gather data.

Surveys are commonly used in the social sciences for descriptive, explanatory, and exploratory research. Descriptive surveys aim to accurately portray the characteristics of a population. Explanatory surveys look at relationships between variables and aim to explain or predict phenomena. Exploratory surveys are conducted to gain preliminary insight into a topic when there are few existing theories or models.

Surveys allow researchers to gather large amounts of data from many people in a short amount of time. They are versatile methods that can be conducted through various modes, like online, paper, interviews, etc. By standardizing survey questions and sampling procedures, researchers can make inferences and generalizations about the larger population based on the survey data. Surveys are an important tool for gathering quantitative data about people's behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and opinions on a topic.

## Guidelines for Asking Questions

When creating survey questions, follow these guidelines:

- **Choose Appropriate Question Forms** - Use open-ended, close-ended, scale, or ranking questions as needed. Open-ended questions allow free responses while close-ended have set responses. Scales rate intensity and ranking orders preferences. Choose forms suited to the data needed.
- **Make Items Clear** - Questions should be simple, specific, and easily understood. Avoid vague terms and be as precise as possible.
- **Avoid Double-Barreled Questions** - Ask only one question at a time. Combining two questions distorts results.
- **Respondents must be competent to answer the item** - Make sure the respondent is qualified to provide meaningful answers. Don't ask questions outside their expertise.
- **Respondents Must Be Willing to Answer** - Avoid sensitive or uncomfortable questions that deter responses. Keep it professional.
- **Questions Should Be Relevant** - Each question should clearly help address the overall research aims. No superfluous questions.
- **Short Items Are Best** - Keep questions concise. Long winding questions are harder to understand.

## Questionnaire Construction

The format of a questionnaire can have an impact on the quality of the data that is collected. Using a clear and logical format is important to ensure respondents understand the questions and answer appropriately.

When a questionnaire contains contingency questions, where the respondent is directed to a different part of the survey based on a previous answer, the format needs to be very clear. Without a clear format, respondents may not follow the skip patterns correctly or answer questions that were not intended for them.

A matrix format can be an efficient way to present multiple questions that share the same response categories. Displaying questions in a table with common answers across the top allows respondents to easily see the options for multiple questions at once.

The order that questions are presented in a survey can influence the way respondents answer. Questions early on may frame how they interpret and respond to subsequent questions. Sensitivity of questions is also a factor in order design. Grouping similar topics together is a common approach to creating a logical flow for respondents.

Pretesting the questionnaire with a small group of respondents is important to identify any issues with format, order or clarity before administering to the full study sample. A clear, logical format and order is crucial for collecting high quality data from survey respondents.
