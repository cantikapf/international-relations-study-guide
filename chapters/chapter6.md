## Introduction

Security has been a heavily debated concept within International Security Studies (ISS), evolving significantly from its origins in post-World War II discussions on protecting states and societies from external and internal dangers. At its core, security encompasses the preservation of core values and freedom from threats for individuals, groups, and nations. However, there remains substantial disagreement within ISS on the primary focus and scope of security, whether it should center on safeguarding individual citizens, nation-states, the international system, or an emerging global society. 

During the Cold War, the predominant focus was on national security, emphasizing military capabilities to combat immediate threats, often blurring the lines between state and societal protection. The Cold War period solidified this conception, with security largely defined in relation to state power and external dangers. As the complexities of globalization emerged in the post-Cold War era, debates widened to incorporate political, economic, societal and environmental aspects of security. The introduction of transnational issues like terrorism, financial crises, climate change and cyberattacks highlighted the interconnectedness of security across borders and the potential need to shift from national to international or global perspectives. This evolution challenged traditional notions of security centered on military force and urgencies of danger and protection.

Discussions now wrestle with the compatibility of national, international and global security, and whether the proper focus should be the security of states, societies, individuals or humanity collectively. Theories like realism continue to view powerful nation-states as the key actors in global affairs while alternative perspectives emphasize the role of communities, institutions, shared ideas and gender identities. As security discourse continues to be contested and revised in complex ways, a comprehensive understanding requires examining the conceptual origins of security and how perspectives have shifted over time in response to new threats, technologies and global relationships.

## Internal vs External Threats

During the Cold War, there was a notable shift in focus from internal, domestic threats to the prominence of external threats in conceptualizations of national security. In the early postwar period, countries were largely preoccupied with internal economic recovery and stability. However, the onset of the Cold War quickly changed this focus towards perceiving the communist Soviet Union as the primary external threat. 

As tensions escalated between the Western and Eastern blocs, led by the United States and Soviet Union respectively, the threat of nuclear war and communist expansionism came to dominate security thinking. Countries aligned with the West saw communism as an ideological and existential threat. This worsened fears of domestic communist movements and influence as constituting an internal danger.

The rise of the Cold War led to security being equated with building military power to deter the external communist threat. By the 1960s, massive buildups of nuclear and conventional arms characterized the security policies of both superpowers. The space and arms race between the two blocs further entrenched this external focus. Domestic policies and spending increasingly centered on resisting external communist encroachment.

This evolution marked a foundational shift in the concept of national security towards emphasizing external rather than internal threats. The predominance of the bipolar struggle meant security was defined in opposition to the rival bloc rather than driven by internal economic or political goals. This created a dichotomy between national security and domestic policy that would have ramifications long after the end of the Cold War era.

## National vs International Security

The compatibility of national and international security has been questioned in contemporary discussions. Some argue that national and international security are inherently incompatible concepts. According to this view, states will always prioritize their own national security interests over broader international security concerns. As a result, collective action problems persist in addressing global security challenges, as states remain unable or unwilling to make sacrifices for the greater international good.

However, others reject the notion that national and international security are incompatible. They contend that it is possible to align national security interests with wider international security objectives. In their view, enhancing international security can also bolster a nation's own security. For example, mitigating threats like climate change, nuclear proliferation, and terrorism requires broad multilateral cooperation across states. Therefore, working to further international security can serve national security interests.  

Advocates of this perspective cite security communities and international institutions as evidence that national and global security can be mutually reinforcing. Alliances like NATO demonstrate that states can sometimes sublimate purely national interests to further collective defense and common values. International organizations like the UN Security Council also provide mechanisms for reconciling national prerogatives with international responsibilities for peace and security.

According to this viewpoint, the interconnectedness of the modern world requires reconceptualizing national security in more international terms. Globalization means that few security threats can be addressed unilaterally today. While tensions remain, there are increasing incentives for aligning national security strategies with international security priorities.

## Global Security

The emergence of an embryonic global society in the post-Cold War era challenged the appropriateness of a narrow focus on national or international security. Increased globalization introduced new risks that were not limited by national borders, requiring a broader conceptualization of security.

Some of the key risks that emerged in the post-Cold War era as a result of globalization included international terrorism, breakdowns in the global monetary system, global warming and associated climate change, cyber conflicts and hacking that could disrupt critical infrastructure, and the heightened dangers of nuclear accidents or mishaps with global implications. 

Whereas national security focuses on protecting the interests of a particular nation-state, and international security examines security dynamics between nation-states, global security encompasses security threats that affect the entire world. This includes risks tied to the global commons - domains that lie outside national jurisdiction such as the oceans, space, and the internet. Threats within these domains require cooperative solutions between nation-states.

Global security risks also highlight the interconnectedness of countries through complex interdependence. With deepening globalization, risks and threats can quickly spread transnationally through economic, environmental, health, and information channels. This suggests that no single country can achieve absolute security within its own borders without considering the security of other nations. 

Some scholars argue that global security should focus primarily on protecting people rather than states. This human security approach emphasizes security challenges related to inequality, infectious diseases, environmental degradation, migration, and human rights abuses. It examines how these issues undermine the safety, dignity, and livelihoods of individuals worldwide.

Overall, the post-Cold War era necessitated an evolution in thinking from national security to global security. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected through globalization, security can no longer be viewed through a narrow national lens. A global perspective recognizes that one country's insecurity often spills over to affect others, requiring cooperative solutions to manage emerging transnational threats.

## Theoretical Perspectives on Security

**Realism** has been one of the dominant theoretical perspectives within ISS. It views states as the key actors in an anarchic 'self-help' world where power is the currency. For realists, military capabilities are central to security, and power balancing is critical to prevent potential hegemony. Realism advocates that states focus on their national interests and maximize their relative power capabilities. It has been criticized for an overly state-centric view that downplays non-military dimensions of security.

**Liberalism** offers an alternative perspective, with institutional liberalism arguing that international institutions can promote security through cooperation, collective security, democracy, and economic interdependence. Institutions help mitigate anarchy's constraints, facilitate cooperation using international law and norms, and make the costs of non-cooperation higher. However, critics argue that liberal institutionalism is too optimistic about progress through interdependence and democracy. 

**Constructivism** provides a starkly different take by arguing that core aspects of international relations are socially constructed rather than given by nature. The identities and interests of states and other actors are not predetermined but are shaped through social interaction. Thus, constructivists focus on the role of identity, norms, and ideas rather than just material capabilities. Changing social structures, including the nature of threats and appropriate responses, can transform international politics.

## Alternative Perspectives 


**Critical theories** adopt a reflective stance to security by questioning mainstream assumptions and perspectives. They aim to reveal how practices and discourses surrounding security can disadvantage or harm particular groups. Feminist approaches in ISS emphasize how gender relations and masculinities are embedded within global politics and security practices. Post-structuralists focus on how language and knowledge shape our understanding of threats and appropriate policy responses.

**Feminist perspectives** shed light on the often overlooked gender dimension in international security. They recognize that war and conflict have differential impacts on men and women. Women are disproportionately affected by violence, displacement, and the breakdown of social services during conflict. However, women are often excluded from formal peace processes and post-conflict reconstruction. Feminist scholars argue that incorporating gender perspectives can lead to more inclusive and sustainable security policies.

**Post-structuralist** views challenge dominant security discourses that privilege the nation-state and military responses. Changing the discourse around security may fundamentally alter international politics. Post-structuralists contend that security should focus on emancipating individuals rather than empowering states. This involves critically examining the language and social structures that contribute to conflict and instability. Post-structuralism opens space for diverse voices and perspectives largely marginalized in traditional security studies. It encourages questioning underlying assumptions and power dynamics inherent in mainstream security paradigms.

## Introduction to Realism

Realism is one of the major theoretical perspectives in the study of international relations. It emphasizes the competitive and conflictual side of international politics, arguing that the fundamental nature of international politics is defined by power politics among states in an anarchic international system.

According to realism, states are the most important actors in the international system. The key assumptions of realism include:

- Groupism - States are unified rational actors that have national interests. Domestic factors such as political ideology, culture, and economic structures influence how the national interest is defined. Nationalism binds the people together and allows the state to act as a unitary actor.

- Egoism - States act to further their own national interests rather than common interests. They seek to maximize their own power and security. Morality and ideology play little role in shaping state behavior.

- Power-centrism - Power is the currency of international politics. The distribution of power shapes state behavior and sets the parameters for cooperation or conflict. Power is both a means to an end and an end in itself for states.

- Statism - States are the dominant units in the international system. Non-state actors such as international organizations have minimal influence over state behavior and the course of international relations. 

- Survival - States are preoccupied with security and survival in the international system. Self-preservation is the foremost goal that shapes foreign policy.

Realism views international politics as an endless struggle for power among self-interested states in a hostile environment. It contends that the pursuit of state interests propels world politics, not ideologies, values, or international law. With no higher authority above states, the international system is anarchic, forcing states to ultimately rely on their own capabilities to survive. This creates a security dilemma, whereby actions taken by states to increase their own security threaten others. This competitive dynamic fosters conflict and wars.

## Key Assumptions

The realist paradigm operates on three key assumptions that characterize how states interact in the international system:

### Groupism

Realism emphasizes the central role of the state as the primary actor in international relations. States act as coherent unitary entities, driven by national interests and nationalism. International politics is viewed as interactions between competing groups defined by cohesive identities and solidarity that supersedes individual interests. Intra-state divisions are overlooked in favor of presenting a united front to deal with other states in an anarchic global environment.

### Egoism  

The realist view posits that states act in a self-interested manner in pursuit of power and security. National interests take precedence over moral concerns or ideological affinities in determining foreign policy. Leaders make rational calculations to maximize and further the interests of their respective states. Altruism has no place in the realist conception of global politics.

### Power-centrism

Realism highlights power and its distribution as the main currency of international relations. The international order is shaped by configurations of material power capabilities. Hard power in terms of military and economic prowess is seen as the ultimate arbiter in interstate relations. Power is both an end itself, with states seeking to maximize it, as well as a means to achieve security. The unequal distribution of power contributes to global conflicts as states compete for power and influence.

## Classical Realism 

Classical realism emerged in response to the dominant liberal approaches to international relations in the 1930s-1940s. This perspective, as exemplified by Hans Morgenthau's 1948 book "Politics Among Nations," posits that the inherent flaws in human nature lead states to engage in a perpetual struggle for power in the international arena. 

According to classical realists, the selfishness and lust for power that characterize human nature mean that international politics is ultimately driven by each state's desire to dominate others. This creates a constant competition for power and resources among states in an anarchic global system with no overarching authority to maintain order.

Morgenthau, considered a founding father of classical realism, argued that international politics should be understood as aiming to maximize power rather than idealistic goals like human rights or democracy. He contended that morality has little influence over foreign policy, which is shaped mainly by considerations of interest defined in terms of power. This produces an endless jockeying for power and advantage between states that contributes to global instability and the ever-present potential for conflict.

The classical realist perspective stands in stark contrast to liberalism by dismissing notions of progress, shared interests, and international cooperation. Instead, it views the international system as one of ceaseless struggle, where states must rely on the pursuit of national interests defined in Machiavellian terms to survive. This bleak outlook served as an influential counterpoint to liberal idealism in the early Cold War period.

## Structural Realism (Neo-Realism)

Structural realism, also known as neorealism, was developed as a critique of classical realism by Kenneth Waltz in his book "Theory of International Politics". Waltz argued that the outcomes of international relations are shaped more by the structure of the international system than the internal characteristics of states. 

Unlike classical realists who emphasize human nature as a cause of conflict, neorealists focus on how the anarchic structure of the international system fosters competition and conflict between states. In an anarchic system with no overarching authority, states must rely on self-help to ensure their survival. This drives them to pursue power and engage in balancing behavior to prevent other states from achieving hegemony.

Waltz proposes that the distribution of capabilities among great powers is the key force that shapes international outcomes. States in an anarchic international system aim to maximize their share of world power relative to other states. However, the system pressures states to achieve a balance of power rather than hegemony. This is because balancing behaviors by other states will emerge to counter rising powers. 

Overall, neorealism diverges from classical realism by explaining international political outcomes based on the pressures exerted on states by the structure and distribution of capabilities in the international system. Internal factors like human nature are downplayed. Neorealism instead focuses on how systemic, structural factors shape the competitive behavior of rationally acting states within an anarchic international environment.

<br>

## Defensive Realism 

Defensive realism, as exemplified by Stephen Walt's "balance of threat" theory, asserts that states, driven by rational choice, seek to maintain the status quo, focusing on an offense-defense balance. States are primarily concerned with their own security and survival within the international system. According to defensive realists, the anarchic structure of the international system compels states to pursue defensive strategies aimed at preserving power and influence rather than maximizing power. 

Defensive realism diverges from offensive realism in viewing the international system as one of status quo rather than revisionist powers. States are inclined to maintain existing spheres of influence rather than expand. According to Walt's balance of threat theory, states ally to balance against threats rather than sheer power alone. Threats are determined based on factors like aggregate power, geographic proximity, offensive capabilities and perceived intentions. Defensive realism emphasizes that states balance against the most significant threats to their security through internal efforts or external alliances. The distribution of power alone does not predict outcomes. Defensive realists contend that the international system remains in equilibrium through this continuous process of balancing against threats.

## Offensive Realism 

Offensive realism, represented by John Mearsheimer, contends that in an uncertain international environment, relative capabilities are paramount, advocating for the acquisition of power to enhance security.

Offensive realism diverges from defensive realism in its emphasis on power maximization over the status quo. In Mearsheimer's theory, the international system's anarchic structure compels states to seek as much power as possible to ensure their own survival. With no central authority to mediate disputes, states cannot be certain of each other's intentions. 

Mearsheimer argues that the best way for a state to survive in such a self-help system is to be as powerful as possible relative to potential rivals. Offensive realism asserts that states are rational actors that will take opportunities to gain power over their competitors. It is the structure of the international system, not human nature, that pushes states to act offensively and aggressively.

According to Mearsheimer, the ultimate goal for great powers is to achieve regional hegemony. By maximizing their relative power capabilities, states can deter attacks from rivals and influence international politics. However, because all states vie for dominance, balancing tendencies emerge, causing ceaseless security competition. 

Offensive realism provides an alternative structural perspective to defensive realism in explaining state expansionism and patterns in the global distribution of power. It serves as an influential theory in the study of international security dilemmas and power politics.

## Rise and Fall Realism  

Rise and fall realism challenges the balance of power theories, suggesting that peace is associated with unchallenged supremacy, not power parity. This perspective views the historical trajectory as a succession of rise and fall of great powers.

A key concept in rise and fall realism is the role of hegemony in maintaining stability in the international system. Hegemony refers to the dominance of one state over others. Rise and fall realists argue that an international system with a hegemon, or dominant state, is more stable and peaceful. The hegemon sets the rules and norms of the system.

The power transition theory, developed by A.F.K. Organski, is an important component of rise and fall realism. This theory asserts that the probability of war increases when a rising challenger approaches the power capabilities of a declining hegemon. The theory suggests that power transitions create greater incentives for the declining hegemon to confront the rising power through war before it gains too much strength.

According to power transition theory, the international system goes through cycles of war and peace. Periods of peace occur when there is a dominant hegemonic power. But eventually the hegemon will decline as other nations grow stronger. This leads to a power transition as the rising challenger approaches parity with the hegemon, resulting in greater potential for war. After such a war, a new hegemon typically emerges to usher in another period of relative peace and stability.

Rise and fall realism provides an alternative perspective to balance of power theories by emphasizing the stabilizing role of hegemony. The likelihood of major wars is seen as higher during power transitions between a declining hegemon and a rising challenger. This viewpoint shaped understandings of great power cycles throughout history.

## Neoclassical Realism

Neoclassical realism asserts that systemic pressures interact with domestic variables at the unit level to shape foreign policy decisions. While recognizing the anarchic structure of the international system and the distribution of capabilities as the primary drivers of state behavior, neoclassical realists argue that identifying threats and opportunities within the system can be complex. 

As a result, domestic factors play a crucial intervening role between systemic incentives and foreign policy outcomes. These unit level variables include public opinion, strategic culture, perceptions of leaders, state-society relations, and government institutions. 

Neoclassical realism posits that foreign policy is not directly determined by the international system. Rather, systemic pressures create potential behaviors for states, but domestic variables serve as transmission belts and filters for translating systemic pressures into foreign policy.

Leaders play a key role in this process by interpreting international threats and incentives based on their own perceptions and domestic considerations. However, their freedom of action is constrained by both international and domestic constraints. In this view, foreign policy is the result of strategic choice under the pressure of systemic forces filtered through domestic politics.

<exercise id="3" title="Liberalism In Security Studies">  

## Introduction

Liberalism is a political ideology centered around values like individual freedom, political participation, private property, equal opportunity, and free will. In the context of security studies, liberalism refers to a set of theories that aim to promote peace and cooperation between states. 

Liberalism envisions a world where democracy, economic integration, and international institutions help states overcome mistrust and avoid violent conflict. The liberal peace encompasses the idea that principles like open markets, rule of law, and democratic norms foster security and prosperity.

Various strands of liberal thought contribute to our understanding of how to construct a more peaceful world order. Liberal theories argue states can transcend conflict and competition through embracing tenets of democracy, economic interdependence, and institutionalized cooperation.

<br>

## Traditional Liberalism

Traditional liberalism emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries during the Age of Enlightenment. Key thinkers such as John Locke, Adam Smith, and Immanuel Kant developed foundational ideas about human nature, political systems, economics, and morality.

A core tenet of traditional liberalism is an optimistic view of human nature. Liberals believe that human beings are inherently reasonable and capable of benevolence. While humans may act selfishly at times, their nature is not necessarily evil or vicious. With the proper social and political institutions, liberalism holds that humans can be compelled to act for the greater good.

In terms of political systems, traditional liberals advocate for representative republics over pure democracies or aristocratic rule. Republics that balance popular rule with checks on power tend to negotiate solutions during conflicts rather than resorting to war. Without the drive for glory or conquest of monarchies, republics have less incentive for maintaining massive militaries and initiating wars. Their emphasis on civic participation and discourse leads republics to resolve disputes through discussion and compromise.

 **Foundation for peace based on traditional liberalism:** 
1. Republican civil constitution of every state
2. Law of nations founded on a federation of free states
3. Law of world citizenship limited to condition of universal hospitability

## Commercial Liberalism

The core argument of commercial liberalism is that economic interdependence between countries reduces the likelihood of war. This idea emerged from the critique of mercantilism in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Mercantilism was the dominant economic ideology in Europe, which held that nations should hoard gold and establish colonies to export more than they imported. In contrast, liberal thinkers argued that trade among nations is mutually beneficial rather than a zero-sum competition.

Several key insights underpinned this critique:

- **Douce Commerce Theory**:  Trade among states was mutually beneficial
- **Comparative Advantage**: David Ricardo's theory stated that nations prosper by focusing production on areas where they have a relative efficiency edge, and trading for other goods. This promotes economic specialization and peaceful exchange.
- **Division of Labor**: Adam Smith argued trade allows nations to divide labor, increase overall productivity, and reduce conflict. His concept of the "invisible hand" suggested that in an open economy, individuals pursuing self-interest can benefit society overall.

Later thinkers like James Mill and Joseph Schumpeter built on these ideas, noting how the social changes from capitalism reduced the influence of aristocratic and military elites inclined toward war. Overall, commercial liberalism proposes that the economic incentives of trade and open markets promote peace between nations.

## Democratic Peace Theory

The Democratic Peace Theory posits that democratic regimes are less likely to initiate violent conflicts against other democracies. This theory emphasizes how democratic processes, institutions, and norms promote compromise and discussion over aggression when dealing with other democracies.  

Some key aspects of the Democratic Peace Theory are:

- Democracies tend to avoid wars with each other due to shared norms and compromise through institutions like legislatures and elections. 
- The public nature of decision-making in democracies facilitates signaling and credibility between democratic leaders. This increases trust and resolve in negotiations compared to more opaque autocratic regimes.
- Liberal states tend to trust other liberal states and expect to resolves conflict through discussion and compromise
- Liberal democratic states do not fight war against other liberal democratic states. that's why democratic states spread democratic liberal ideology to other states

## Neoliberal Institutionalism Promotes Peace Through International Cooperation

Neoliberal institutionalism argues that international institutions play a vital role in reducing conflicts among democratic states. According to this theory, institutions help guarantee trust between countries by redefining state roles and acting as arbitrators. 

Institutions allow for more cooperation by providing highly institutionalized settings that reduce transaction costs and alter payoffs for peaceful interactions versus conflict. States can more easily find mutually beneficial solutions through the framework of international institutions.

Specifically, institutions promote peace among democracies by facilitating communication, negotiation, rule-setting, and enforcement. They create repeated games, reciprocity, and reputation building between states. Institutions also discourage democratic states from abandoning cooperation since it would harm their standing.

Additionally, institutions disseminate information to reassure states and reduce uncertainty about others' motives. They monitor state behaviors and punish violations, mitigating security dilemmas. Institutions align expectations, signal benign intentions, arbitrate disputes, and verify compliance.

## Case Studies

### NATO as an Example of Security Institution

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is often cited as an example of a security institution that has persisted beyond its original purpose. NATO was formed in 1949 as an alliance between North American and European countries to counter potential Soviet aggression during the Cold War. However, even after the end of the Cold War and dissolution of the Soviet Union, NATO has endured as a key security institution.

Unlike a traditional military alliance, NATO has established intergovernmental structures including a Secretary General, international staff, and integrated military command. It has also adapted its mission from purely collective defense to include crisis management, cooperative security, and partnership. NATO has formal decision-making processes and its members engage in regular diplomatic coordination and joint military planning and exercises. This institutionalization has enabled NATO to outlive the Cold War threat.

## Levels of Analysis

Waltz's analysis argues that the causes of conflict and cooperation exist at three different levels: individual, state, and international system. At the individual level, human nature and the decisions of leaders play a role, where liberal thinking holds that human nature is not inherently vicious. The state level examines how domestic politics, ideologies, and institutions shape a state's external behavior and interactions. For example, liberal theory contends that non-democratic regimes like dictatorships are more likely to initiate conflicts. At the international system level, the structure and distribution of power between states affects the likelihood of war and peace. A multipolar structure with many competing major powers tends to create more potential for clashes than a bipolar or unipolar structure. Overall, the interactions between the three levels of individuals, states, and global structure combine to determine patterns of conflict and cooperation according to liberal analysis.

## **How suitable is neoliberal institutionalism with regard to security issue?**

- Realm of security has special characteristic that make regime creation more difficult and increase it needs. States will establish an institution if they seek the goals that the institution will help them reach. In other words, institution do not do much to increase security
- Distinction between alliance and security institution is for example, NATO persisted after the end of the Cold War because it was not a simple alliance; rather it was a security institution
- Two ideal type security system: alliance and community of law

<exercise id="4" title="Constructivism And Other Approach In Security Studies">  

# Contructivism

Constructivism is an influential theoretical approach in international relations that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s. Drawing on sociological insights, constructivism emphasizes the social construction of the world through ongoing processes of interaction between agents and structures. It asserts that international politics is shaped not just by material factors, but also socially constructed norms, identities, and ideas. 

At the core of constructivism is the premise that agents (e.g. states, leaders, communities) and structures (e.g. international systems and institutions) constitute one another through their interactions. Agents make decisions and take actions based on intersubjective meanings, collective knowledge, and social norms, not just material calculations. Meanwhile, structures like international law and organizations are created by states and shape state interests and behavior.

Constructivism stands in contrast to rationalist international relations theories like neorealism that focus primarily on the distribution of material capabilities. Instead, constructivism highlights the central role of ideational factors, shared knowledge, and social relationships in world politics. It provides a sociological lens to examine how interests and identities are produced, how norms emerge and evolve, and how security and power are socially constructed over time.

## Core Tenets

Constructivism emphasizes the **social construction of international relations through the mutual constitution of agents and structures**. It asserts that structures, such as norms and identities, shape and influence agents like states. At the same time, agents impact structures through their actions and interactions. This mutual constitution highlights the interplay between agents and structures in world politics. 

Central to constructivism is the concept of intersubjectivity. Intersubjectivity refers to the shared understandings and meanings that emerge through social interactions between agents. Rather than existing independently, identities and interests are relationally constructed and develop through intersubjective processes. Shared knowledge, norms, ideas, and perceptions shape how states understand each other and inform their relations. Intersubjectivity is key to how agents socially construct international relations.

## Constructivism on Security

Constructivism provides important insights into how we conceive of security in world politics. According to constructivist principles, security is a socially constructed concept rather than an objective condition. Agents, such as states, negotiate the meaning and implications of security through social interactions and collective understanding. 

Particularly, constructivism proposes that states designate other states as 'friends' or 'enemies' based on shared identities and norms instead of material factors. The structure of the international system, characterized by anarchy between states, can shape relations. But states also constitute structures like the anarchic system through their practices and beliefs. So agents and structures exist in a reciprocal, mutually constitutive relationship.

Moreover, security involves continuous processes of contestation and negotiation. Political leaders shape security policies based on domestic priorities and pressures, not just external threats. Public audiences also significantly influence security's meaning and effects through mass communication and collective sensemaking. Overall, constructivism emphasizes the fluid, intersubjective construction of security rather than viewing it as a static objective condition.

# The Copenhagen School

Emerging from the defunct Copenhagen Peace Research Institute, the Copenhagen School broadens the concept of security beyond just military concerns to include issues like environmental degradation, poverty, and human rights abuses. This school of thought focuses on how security threats are socially constructed and given meaning through intersubjective processes between political leaders, experts, and the public. 

A core contribution of the Copenhagen School is the framework of "securitization" proposed by Barry Buzan, Ole Wæver, and others. Securitization refers to the process by which an issue is turned into a security threat that requires emergency action. This occurs when a securitizing actor (e.g. a political leader) declares an existential threat, convincing a target audience to accept exceptional measures beyond normal politics. Issues can also be "desecuritized" when they are no longer treated as security matters. 

According to the Copenhagen School, security threats do not exist independently, but rather are constructed through speech acts and intersubjective meaning-making. Their framework examines how securitization operates across various sectors like the environment, economy, and health. It also looks at regional security complexes where security interdependencies bind certain groups of states together. Overall, the Copenhagen School provides a constructivist approach to security that centers discourse, identity, norms, and the social construction of threats.

## Notable Figures

The Copenhagen School is associated with several influential scholars who have contributed substantially to its theoretical development and conceptual frameworks.

### Barry Buzan

Barry Buzan is widely considered the founder of the Copenhagen School. As a professor at the University of Copenhagen, Buzan wrote extensively on security studies and international relations. His work introduced pivotal concepts like securitization theory and sectors of security. Major publications include "People, States and Fear: An Agenda for International Security Studies in the Post-Cold War Era" (1991) and "Security: A New Framework for Analysis" (1998) co-authored with Ole Wæver and Jaap de Wilde.

### Ole Wæver

Ole Wæver, a Danish political scientist, is another prominent theorist of the Copenhagen School. Wæver collaborated closely with Barry Buzan and advanced securitization theory, analyzing how issues become labeled as security threats. His key works include "Identity, Migration and the New Security Agenda in Europe" (1993) and "Securitization and Desecuritization" (1995) with Barry Buzan.

### Jaap de Wilde 

As a Dutch academic, Jaap de Wilde contributed significantly to the Copenhagen School's theoretical breadth. De Wilde's research delved into environmental security and European cooperation. He co-wrote the seminal book "Security: A New Framework for Analysis" with Barry Buzan and Ole Wæver in 1998, cementing core Copenhagen School concepts.

# Critical Theory Challenges Traditional Notions of Security

Critical theory provides a philosophical and ideological critique of traditional international relations theory and conceptions of security. Rather than accepting the premise of security studies at face value, critical theorists question the underlying assumptions and perspectives that shape mainstream security discourse. 

Most notably, critical theory views security as a 'derivative concept' - meaning one's understanding and definition of security is not objective, but rather derives from broader political, philosophical and ideological outlooks. Critical theory rejects the notion that the study of security can be value-neutral or objective.

Instead, critical theorists emphasize the inherent subjectivity involved in conceptualizing security. They argue that how we define threats and referents of security stems from subjective political positions and normative values. There is no purely objective way to study security aside from the perspective of the observer.  

This aligns with critical theory's broader mission to challenge dominant modes of thought and Structures of power. Critical theorists aim to reveal the contingency and malleability of social reality, as opposed to treating current conditions as natural or inevitable.

In terms of methodology, critical theory distinguishes itself from traditional 'problem-solving' theories that take institutions and social power structures as givens. Instead, critical theory treats theory itself as a form of practice - using critique to reveal and challenge hidden assumptions. The goal is emancipation from dominant paradigms through ideological critique. This underpins the critical theory perspective on security.

## The Welsh School of Critical Security Studies

Wales, United Kingdom has become a hub for the development and expansion of critical security studies. The Welsh School of Critical Security Studies focuses on deepening the understanding of security by examining the concept through alternative viewpoints. 

Scholars associated with the Welsh School aim to broaden the definition of security beyond just the military domain. They argue that security should encompass economic, societal, environmental, and human rights issues as well. The Welsh School also emphasizes the subjectivity of security, asserting that one's conception of security derives significantly from their political and philosophical perspective.

The Welsh School distinguishes itself from traditional international relations theory by rejecting rigid positivism and notions of objectivism. Instead, scholars view theory as a form of practice in itself that is intrinsically linked to promoting change. The Welsh School considers the emancipatory potential of critical security studies. How can these alternative conceptions of security empower people and lead to greater justice? The Welsh School grapples with these normative questions.

Overall, the development of the Welsh School has been pivotal in expanding the boundaries of security studies. It has pushed theorists to reconsider traditional state-military centered views and incorporate a wider range of security concerns. The Welsh School's critical orientation questions prevailing assumptions and power dynamics while aiming to give voice to marginalized peoples. Its contributions have enriched international relations theory and security studies.

Critical theorists have challenged traditional perspectives on international relations and security through their writings and research. Several prominent scholars stand out for their contributions to critical theory and critical security studies:

**Robert Cox** was a Canadian political scientist known for his critical theory work on international relations. He emphasized the subjectivity inherent in theories, which he argued derive from a theorist's political outlook and interests. Cox distinguished between problem-solving theory and critical theory, with the latter taking a more reflexive approach to challenge assumptions. His writings like "Social Forces, States and World Orders" and "Gramsci, Hegemony and International Relations" were influential in applying and advancing critical theory.

**Max Horkheimer** was a German philosopher and sociologist who helped found the Frankfurt School of critical theory. With Theodor Adorno, he wrote "Dialectic of Enlightenment" which critiqued Western modernity and instrumental reason. Horkheimer's work highlighted how human domination over nature related to social domination, bringing a critical perspective to capitalism, science and progress. His insights on enlightenment, myth and reason contributed to critical theory as applied to international relations.

**Ken Booth** is a prominent Welsh scholar who helped develop critical security studies and the Welsh School. Booth emphasized the need to expand our understanding of security beyond just the state level. His writings like "Critical Explorations" and "Theory of World Security" challenged realist perspectives, calling for a more ethical approach to international relations and security. Booth helped establish security as a "derivative concept" shaped by language, politics and power relations rather than a self-evident, objective notion.

# Feminism

Feminist perspectives in security studies have challenged patriarchal assumptions and provided distinctive insights. Feminists focus on the gendered nature of global politics, exposing how security discourse contains masculine biases. For example, protection and defense are framed around stereotypically male traits like strength and aggression. 

Feminists also highlight how women often hold more cooperative and peace-oriented viewpoints compared to men. This cooperative ethic stems from women's shared experience of subordination and vulnerability. Women leaders sometimes employ negotiation and compromise to a greater degree.

Moreover, armed conflict and political violence have differential impacts based on gender. Women and girls disproportionately suffer from conflict, facing increased risks of sexual violence and exploitation. Yet their perspectives are frequently excluded when addressing solutions for conflict and security.

Feminist scholars emphasize the need to include women in security policymaking in an equitable way. Both women's viewpoints and lived experiences in situations of insecurity should help shape discussions of international security. Mainstreaming gender in policy formulation leads to more comprehensive solutions.

The feminist critique has enriched understandings of security by revealing typically overlooked assumptions. It demonstrates how factors like gender norms and identities construct the meaning of security in global politics and society. Feminist approaches continue to provide vital alternative frameworks for rethinking security.
