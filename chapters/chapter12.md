## Definition of Development Countries

The World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) report classifies all countries of the world into one of three categories: developed economies, the subgroup of “major developed economies”, which is based on the membership of the Group of Seven economies in transition and developing economies. 

Geographical regions for developing economies are as follows: Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean.

A development country can be defined as a country with a relatively high level of economic growth and security. The main criteria used to evaluate development status include:

- Per capita income or gross domestic product (GDP)
- Level of industrialization  
- General standard of living and amount of widespread infrastructure
- Human Development Index (HDI) which reflects relative degrees of education, literacy and health

## Features of a Developed Country

A developed country is characterized by certain key features across economic, political, social, health, education, equity, corruption, and environmental factors.

### Economic Development

Economically, a developed country has a high level of gross domestic product, high income per capita, and a significant degree of industrialization. The economy is oriented around providing services and value-added industry rather than agriculture and raw material extraction. There is substantial infrastructure to support economic activity.

### Industrialization and Foreign Trade

A developed country has a strong manufacturing sector and engages significantly in international trade. Goods are manufactured domestically and exported.

### Political Stability 

Politically, a developed country has stable governance, often democratic, with strong institutions. There is an effective system of law and respect for regulations. The level of corruption is low. Citizens are able to participate in the political process.

### Health and Education

The populations of developed countries have high levels of education, literacy, and advanced healthcare systems. People live long lives with good access to medical treatment. Education is widespread with high enrollment rates.

### Social Equity

Developed countries have relatively high degrees of social and gender equality. Poverty rates are lower. There is a strong social safety net.

### Low Corruption

Developed countries have low levels of corruption in government, business, and society. The rule of law prevails.

### Clean Environment

Developed countries utilize regulations, incentives, and technology to maintain high environmental standards and mitigate pollution. There is substantial focus on clean energy and sustainability.

## Overview of Foreign Policy Analysis

Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA) emerged as a subfield of International Relations in the late 1980s, with a focus on developing middle range theories to explain foreign policy decision making. Prior to this, the IR research community had concentrated on the major paradigms of Realism, Liberalism, and Constructivism. 

FPA aims to understand the actual conduct and practice of foreign policy, concentrating more on state agency rather than broad structural factors. It examines how and why states make the foreign policy decisions they do, considering the role of factors like domestic politics, individual leaders, and bureaucratic politics.

Some key developments in the field include:

- In 1988, the International Studies Association established an FPA section. This helped to cement FPA as a recognized subfield within IR.
- In 1991, the journal *Foreign Policy Analysis* was launched, providing a dedicated platform for FPA research.
- Research has expanded from a focus on the US and USSR during the Cold War era to incorporate more comparative analysis across different states and time periods. New theoretical approaches have also emerged.
- Scholars have worked to integrate insights from psychology, cognitive science, and decision-making theory to better understand the individual level.

So while structural theories still dominate IR, FPA has carved out an important niche examining the microfoundations of foreign policy and state behavior.

## Defining Foreign Policy

Foreign policies are the strategies governments use to guide their actions in the international arena. Foreign policy often are studied by focusing on a single country (e.g., a decision on the use of force by a U.S. president) or across nations (e.g., comparing environmental decisions by leaders of US, UK, Germany, France, and Italy) or across time (e.g., comparing decisions of U.S. presidents in the first and second Iraq wars). 

Foreign policy analysis is the study of the conduct and practice of relations between different actors, primarily states, in the international system. International relations aims to interpret broad features of international system (‘structure’); foreign policy analysis concentrates on actual state conduct and the sources of decisions (‘agency’).

## Relevance of Foreign Policy

Foreign policy refers to the official external relations conducted by an independent actor, usually a state, in international relations. It encompasses what they choose to do in the international arena. 

Foreign policy may be approached in many different ways within the field of International Relations:

- Through the lens of international history - studying the impact of foreign policy decisions throughout history.
- Via country studies - analyzing the foreign policy of a specific nation in detail.
- By examining foreign policy theories - using conceptual models to understand and explain foreign policy behaviors.
- As a comparative study - contrasting the foreign policies of different states and governments.
- From an international organization perspective - looking at how IOs shape and influence foreign policy.
- Using levels of analysis - evaluating foreign policy at the individual, domestic, or international system levels.
- Through interdisciplinary approaches - incorporating insights from political science, economics, psychology and other fields.


## Theoretical Approaches in FPA

Foreign policy analysis is fundamentally interested in the actual conduct and practices of states in their external relations, as opposed to broader structural theories of the international system. It concentrates on the sources of foreign policy decisions as expressions of state agency.

The theoretical approach to foreign policy making encompasses various schools of thought, each with its own perspective on the factors influencing foreign policy decisions. Some of the main theoretical approaches include:

1. **Realism**: This school of thought emphasizes the importance of national interests and power in shaping foreign policy. It focuses on the interactions between states and the international system, rather than on domestic factors.
2. **Liberalism**: Liberal theorists argue that foreign policy is deeply embedded in the domestic situation of a country, with state preferences defined by various individuals and organized groups representing different interests.
3. **Neoliberalism**: This approach combines elements of realism and liberalism, focusing on both systemic and economic determinants of foreign policy. It highlights the blurring of distinction between foreign and domestic policy due to processes of economic integration, codification of international rules, globalization, and technological development.
4. **Constructivism**: Constructivists emphasize the importance of ideational factors, such as history, culture, norms, and values, in shaping foreign policy. They argue that these factors lead to the creation of intersubjective identities that define mutual perceptions between nations.
5. **Neoclassical Realism**: This approach combines elements of classical realism and neorealism, focusing on both systemic incentives and unit-level intervening variables that distort the realization of national interests. It acknowledges the importance of domestic factors in shaping foreign policy decisions.

In addition to these theoretical approaches, the study of foreign policy making in Japan as a contentious process highlights the role of domestic-level factors, such as elite cohesion, social cohesion, and the influence of the prime minister and ruling parties. It also examines the impact of central government reforms on the balance of power in foreign policy making.

## Changing International Context

The international context in which foreign policy occurs has undergone major changes in recent decades. Three key elements represent this transformation:

- **End of the Cold War** - The Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States dominated international relations for over four decades after World War II. This global ideological struggle shaped foreign policies worldwide. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 ended the Cold War era, removing the bipolar constraints on international relations and enabling increased economic and political cooperation.
- **Globalization** - Improved communications, transportation, and trade have interconnected the world economy. This process of globalization has created complex interdependence between states. Foreign policies now consider economic interests and non-state actors to a greater degree. Globalization has also enabled the rapid spread of information, ideas, and norms across borders.
- **Humanitarian Intervention** - Since the 1990s, the international community has increasingly accepted the principle of humanitarian intervention to prevent human rights abuses. Foreign policies now consider justifications for military action on humanitarian grounds even within sovereign states. This marks a shift away from absolute state sovereignty. However, controversy remains over when intervention is appropriate.

## Economic Factors

A country's level of economic development is a key factor in determining its status as developed or developing. Economic indicators like GDP per capita, industrialization, infrastructure, and participation in international trade are important metrics. 

Developed countries tend to have diversified, industrialized economies and high GDP per capita. They have modern infrastructure and robust international trade. Developing countries often rely more on agriculture and resource extraction. They have lower GDP per capita and less advanced infrastructure. 

Industrialization brings job creation, rising incomes, and improved standards of living. Manufacturing and services become larger shares of the economy compared to primary sectors like farming. Developed countries have undergone industrialization and most employment is in services and high-tech industries rather than agriculture.

Trade liberalization can accelerate growth and development. Developed countries actively participate in international trade and make up the majority of global exports and imports. Developing countries often face trade barriers that hinder export opportunities. Expanding trade access creates economic growth opportunities.

In summary, developed nations have thriving industrial and service economies, high GDP per capita, advanced infrastructure, and established international trade ties. Developing countries are working to build their economies through industrialization, infrastructure improvement, and participation in global trade. Strong economic foundations are a prerequisite for developed country status.

## Political Factors

A key political factor that shapes foreign policy in developed countries is political stability. Global governance indicators measure dimensions such as rule of law, transparency, and quality of public and civil services. Countries with higher levels of political stability tend to have more effective and consistent foreign policies. 

For example, the governments of Norway, Switzerland, Canada, and other developed countries with robust democracies are able to implement long-term foreign policy agendas. Their foreign policies evolve gradually over time rather than changing drastically with each election. These governments can make international commitments that span multiple administrations.

In contrast, countries with high political instability and weak rule of law often have inconsistent foreign policies that shift dramatically whenever a new regime comes into power. Their foreign policy may be subordinated to domestic power struggles and lack coherent strategic vision. Weak political institutions undermine their credibility and reliability on the world stage.

Therefore, political stability and quality of governance are key enablers of a strong and effective foreign policy in developed countries. Robust democracies with effective checks and balances are better able to pursue long-term foreign policy goals rooted in national consensus rather than short-term objectives driven by specific leaders or factions.

## Social Factors

Level of development is also correlated with indicators of social wellbeing such as gender equality, poverty rates, and access to education and healthcare. More developed countries tend to have greater gender equality as measured by access to education and political participation for women. They also have lower rates of extreme poverty with stronger social safety nets to support vulnerable populations. Access to education, measured in school enrollment and literacy rates, tends to be higher as well. This is tied to better health outcomes, as developed countries have lower maternal and infant mortality rates along with higher life expectancies. Investing in human capital through healthcare and education has a significant impact on development.

Some key social factors that are associated with a high level of development include:

- Higher education levels and literacy rates
- Improved access to healthcare and lower mortality rates 
- More equitable income distribution and lower poverty rates
- Greater gender equality in education, economic participation, and political representation
- Better protections for minorities and vulnerable groups
- Higher levels of overall social progress as measured by indexes like the Social Progress Index

Improving these social indicators helps create an environment that supports economic growth and improves quality of life. Therefore, investments in healthcare, education, poverty alleviation and social inclusion are important elements in the development process. This underscores the multidimensional nature of development that goes beyond just economic factors.

<exercise id="2" title="Economic Statecraft">    

## What is Economic Statecraft

Economic statecraft refers to the use of economic tools by a state to influence the behavior of another state. It involves wielding economic influence and leveraging economic power to achieve foreign policy objectives. 

Economic statecraft can take both positive and negative forms. Negative economic statecraft involves the use of punitive economic measures like sanctions, tariffs, and trade embargoes to inflict economic pain and coerce a change in behavior of the target state. For example, in 1973 the OPEC countries used the "oil weapon" to punish the US for its support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War by cutting oil exports and hiking prices.

Positive economic statecraft provides economic benefits like trade deals, financial aid, and investment to induce cooperation from the target state. For instance, the US provided extensive financial aid to Western Europe under the Marshall Plan from 1948-1952 to help rebuild economies, create stable democracies, and counter Soviet influence during the early Cold War period.

Economic statecraft has been practiced for centuries, with examples like Athens placing trade sanctions on its rival Megara during the Peloponnesian Wars of Ancient Greece. It remains an important foreign policy tool for major powers like the US, China, EU and others as economic linkages between states continue to deepen.

## Objectives of Economic Statecraft

Economic statecraft aims to use economic tools, relationships, incentives, and sanctions to achieve a range of foreign policy objectives. The key goals of economic statecraft include:

- Satisfying broader foreign policy goals of the implementing nation. Economic statecraft allows countries to wield economic influence to support their foreign policy agendas without resorting to overt military intervention. 
- Influencing the domestic politics and foreign policy behaviors of the target nation. Economic incentives or sanctions apply economic pressure to push a target country to change its domestic policies or international behaviors aligned with the goals of the implementing nation.
- Affecting the capabilities of a regime or government. Economic statecraft can deprive a regime of financial resources to fund government operations, weaken institutions, and reduce political stability. Alternatively, economic incentives can provide resources to empower or stabilize friendly regimes.

The objectives and motivations behind economic statecraft may include security concerns, ideological differences, human rights advocacy, or commercial interests. Ultimately, economic statecraft serves as a tool for nations to project power and influence the behaviors of other states to align with their strategic interests.

## Sanctions as a Tool

Sanctions are restrictive measures imposed by one or more countries against a target to achieve political or economic objectives. They are one of the main tools of economic statecraft. There are several types of sanctions:

- Trade restrictions limit or ban the import and/or export of goods, services, or technologies to or from a target country. For example, in 1973 the OPEC countries imposed an "oil weapon" embargo against the US in retaliation for its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. 
- Financial sanctions restrict a target's access to financial markets, assets, and banking services. In the 1970s the US imposed financial sanctions against Chile, freezing Chilean assets in the US.
- Investment restrictions limit investment and business activities like joint ventures or partnerships with entities from the target country. In the 1990s and 2000s, Western governments imposed investment restrictions on countries in the Middle East and North Africa. 
- Monetary sanctions restrict access to foreign exchange needed to pay for imports or repay debts. For instance, in response to alleged currency manipulation, the US threatened monetary sanctions against China from 2018-2020 during the trade war.

By using these types of sanctions, countries attempt to inflict economic damage on a target in order to coerce changes in policy or behavior. Sanctions can also signal disapproval. Their effectiveness is debated by scholars.

## Case Study: Russia-Ukraine Sanctions

The conflict between Russia and Ukraine began in 2014 when Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. This prompted economic sanctions by Western nations against Russia.

The United States, European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and others imposed a series of economic sanctions against Russia. These included:

- Restrictions on exports of certain oil exploration and production technology to Russia. This limited Russia's ability to develop its oil resources over the long term.
- Bans on exports of dual-use and military items to Russia. This restricted Russia's access to technology and equipment that could be used for military purposes.
- Freezing of assets and blocking access to capital markets for designated Russian banks and companies. This cut off sanctioned Russian firms from Western financing and investment. 
- Bans on exporting infrastructure, energy, and defense goods and services for Russian deepwater, Arctic offshore, or shale oil projects. This blocked access to Western expertise and technology needed to develop these oil resources.
- Restrictions on providing financing or insurance related to exports to Russia of restricted goods and services.

The sanctions have had a sizeable economic impact on Russia. Its GDP declined around 4% due to the sanctions, and the ruble declined sharply in value. Restricted access to Western capital and advanced oil exploration technology may constrain Russia's economic growth over the longer term. 

However, the sanctions have also imposed economic costs on European countries with close trade ties to Russia. For example, Germany has faced declining exports and economic growth due to reduced trade flows. Many European countries rely heavily on Russian oil and gas imports, which increased in cost due to the conflict. The sanctions have revealed a tradeoff between economic interests and security policy for European nations.

## Incentives as a Tool

Incentives can be used as a form of positive economic statecraft to induce changes in the behavior of a target country. Unlike sanctions which use economic pressure, incentives provide economic benefits and rewards to encourage cooperation. 

There are two main types of incentives in economic statecraft:

**Tactical Linkage**

- Provides short-term economic rewards contingent on specific policy changes 
- Used to influence discrete, near-term decisions
- Example: Offering a country reduced tariffs if they agree to certain trade terms

**Structural Linkage**  

- Provides long-term economic integration incentives 
- Aims to gradually change a country's core interests and alignment
- Example: Offering a country access to a free trade area if they reform institutions and regulations

Incentives aim to make cooperation more beneficial than resistance. They create shared interests and incentives for target countries to maintain positive relations. However, incentives may also create economic dependence on the initiating country.

## Case Study: US-China Trade War

The trade war between the United States and China began in January 2018 when the US imposed tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines. This was followed by additional rounds of tariffs by both countries throughout 2018 and 2019. 

The background of the dispute centers around issues like the US trade deficit with China, theft of intellectual property, and forced technology transfers. The US argued that China's unfair trade practices hurt American companies and workers. China contended the tariffs were an act of protectionism.

The US levied tariffs on over $500 billion of Chinese goods, while China imposed tariffs on over $185 billion of US products. The US tariffs targeted consumer goods, industrial equipment, and raw materials. China's tariffs focused heavily on agricultural goods like soybeans, wheat, meat, and dairy.

The trade war negatively impacted both economies but hit China's export-driven economy particularly hard. China's GDP growth slowed to 6.6% in 2018, its lowest rate since 1990. US manufacturing and agriculture faced weaker demand and higher costs. Overall US GDP growth dipped to 2.3% in 2019 compared to 2.9% in 2018.

By using tariffs as a negative tool, the trade war caused economic damage on both sides without resolving the core disputes. After two years of escalation, the countries signed a "phase one" trade deal in January 2020 that paused further tariffs without making major structural changes.

## Evaluating Effectiveness 

Evaluating the effectiveness of economic statecraft policies like sanctions and incentives can be challenging due to the complex nature of their impacts. Some key considerations when assessing effectiveness include:

**Metrics for success** - What are the specific objectives being targeted and how can progress be measured? Common metrics include changes in target country policy/behavior, economic damage to the target country, and pressure on the regime's stability. However, directly attributing observed changes to economic statecraft can be difficult.

**Unintended consequences** - Economic statecraft often has unintended side effects, both positive and negative. Sanctions may rally popular support behind the target regime or create lucrative black markets. Incentives may disproportionately benefit regime insiders. Such secondary effects can undermine or support the original policy goals. 

**Mitigating factors** - The existing economic/political situation in the target country can determine how much leverage sanctions or incentives provide. Wealthy, stable regimes or countries with key geopolitical influence may be less vulnerable to economic pressure.

**Duration required** - Economic statecraft aims to alter a country's long-term behavior, which requires sustained pressure over years in many cases. Short-term impacts often do not reflect the ultimate success or failure.

**Costs to the imposing country** - Economic statecraft also incurs economic and political costs for the country or coalition applying sanctions/incentives. These domestic costs can affect political will to maintain the policies.

Evaluating effectiveness requires tracking progress across multiple indicators over an extended period. Economic statecraft rarely achieves quick or decisive results, so setting realistic expectations is important. Analysts continue to study and debate the efficacy of high-profile examples like Cuba, Iran, and Russia sanctions.

## Ethics of Economic Statecraft

Economic statecraft raises a number of ethical considerations, especially regarding the humanitarian impacts of sanctions and the moral justification of using economic coercion.

One concern is that broad economic sanctions often disproportionately affect civilian populations rather than regime elites. Sanctions on goods like food, medicine, and energy can lead to shortages and price increases that harm vulnerable groups and worsen humanitarian crises. This raises moral questions about intentionally using economic suffering as a policy tool. Just war theory principles like proportionality and discrimination suggest sanctions should target decision-makers rather than whole populations. 

In terms of justifications, sanctions are often portrayed as an alternative to war. However, some ethicists argue economic coercion still amounts to a form of violence and aggression against another society. Sanctions can inflict major harm on people's livelihoods and well-being. Therefore, the act of imposing sanctions requires a high burden of moral justification, beyond mere convenience or presumption of effectiveness.

There are also debates around the legitimacy and fairness of punishing civilians who have limited ability to change their government's policies. While incentives aim to persuade through benefits, sanctions more overtly pressure populations through deprivation. This contradicts ideals of respecting national sovereignty and self-determination.

Overall, economic statecraft involves complex ethical tradeoffs. Policymakers must weigh geopolitical interests against principles of human rights and justice. A higher standard of moral scrutiny may be needed for sanctions that risk humanitarian suffering.

## The Future of Economic Statecraft

The future of economic statecraft will be shaped by several key trends including increased globalization, the rise of new global powers, and advancing technologies that enable more targeted sanctions. 

As the world becomes more interconnected through trade, investment, and financial links, states gain more potential leverage over one another via economic ties. However, increased globalization also means states have more options to find alternative partners if cut off from certain relationships. This could make economic statecraft less impactful in some instances.

The rise of new powers in the international system, like China, also stands to shape the future landscape of economic statecraft. As China gains economic clout, its ability to employ economic statecraft increases. The West's long-held dominance in institutions like the World Bank and IMF may wane as Chinese alternatives like the AIIB emerge. This could lead to greater use of economic tools by China to advance its interests.

Finally, advancing technologies will enable more targeted economic actions in the future. Rather than broad country-wide sanctions, tools like blockchain and digital currencies may allow states to freeze assets or restrict transactions of specific companies or even individuals. However, adaptive technologies like cryptocurrencies could also help regimes circumvent economic statecraft. The cat-and-mouse game of sanctions and evasion will likely continue.

Overall, the terrain of economic statecraft faces new complexities. While states will continue developing tools to exert economic leverage, global trends create new difficulties and opportunities for the effective use of economic statecraft. States will need adaptable, nuanced approaches to stay relevant in this evolving domain.

<exercise id="3" title="Women And Foreign Policy: Swedish Feminist Foreign Policy">    

## Introduction 

Foreign policy decision-making has historically been male-dominated. Institutions and processes involved in formulating foreign policy have traditionally excluded women or minimized their influence. This male dominance stems from societal norms and beliefs that men are more suited to leadership roles, especially in areas involving security, defense and international relations. 

However, throughout history, some powerful women have found ways to shape the foreign policy of their nations. Examples include Cleopatra in ancient Egypt, Queen Elizabeth I in 16th century England, and Catherine the Great in 18th century Russia. In modern times, women like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the UK, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland in Norway, and U.S. Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Hillary Clinton have played major roles in foreign policy. 

So while foreign policy decision-making remains disproportionately male, women have always looked for opportunities to exert influence through formal and informal means. Their impact reminds us that foreign policy ultimately reflects a diversity of perspectives, including both men and women.

## Societal Factors Influencing Women in Foreign Policy

Societal beliefs and norms have shaped the role of women in foreign policy over time. Traditional patriarchal views about gender roles position men as acceptable for dominant positions in society and institutions, while women face assumptions of inferiority. 

Historically, social constructs based around patriarchy became entrenched in many cultures. Men were seen as suited for leadership, authority and decision-making positions. Women, in contrast, were often relegated to domestic roles or excluded from public life. 

Under patriarchal systems, the idea that men should control politics, institutions and the public sphere became an accepted societal norm. This led to women being systematically denied positions of leadership and power throughout history, including in foreign policy.

Patriarchal values embedded in society meant women faced barriers to entering foreign policy. They were seen as unsuited or incapable when it came to formulating policy, diplomacy or representing the state. 

These ingrained societal beliefs about gender roles excluded women from foreign policy institutions and decision-making. The assumption was that women did not belong in a realm viewed as men's domain.

Overall, patriarchal views of male and female roles within society have significantly influenced women's participation in foreign policy historically. Deeply entrenched ideas of male dominance and superiority kept women out of foreign policy positions and marginalized their voices. Challenging these societal beliefs has been crucial in enabling more women to play meaningful roles in international relations and policy.

## Organizational Factors

Organizational factors within institutions and governments also influence the role of women in foreign policy. A key issue is the extent to which institutions are structured to support women in the workplace. The division of labor and opportunity for advancement within organizations shapes the prospects for women to obtain important leadership and decision-making positions.

For example, foreign policy institutions have traditionally been male-dominated, with norms and cultures that favored men for senior roles and leadership positions. This created barriers for women seeking to rise through the ranks into positions of influence over foreign policy decisions. Discrimination, glass ceilings, lack of work-life balance policies, and boys club cultures made it difficult for women to succeed.  

However, as institutions evolve to promote greater diversity and inclusion, the organizational barriers facing women can be reduced. Policies providing flexible work arrangements, paid family leave, affordable childcare, and mentorship help create an environment where women can thrive professionally. Improving recruitment, hiring, and promotion practices also enables more women to attain leadership roles where they can shape foreign policy priorities and strategies.

The organizational composition and labor structure of foreign policy institutions have a major impact on opening pathways for women to reach the highest levels of decision-making power. As these institutional factors change to be more inclusive, the role of women in formulating foreign policy expands.

## Individual Factors

A woman's individual background and experiences shape her path in foreign policy. Key individual factors include:

- Family and Upbringing. A woman's family background and upbringing influences her access to education, experiences, and career opportunities. Women from privileged backgrounds may have more resources and encouragement to pursue foreign policy, while women lacking family support may face more obstacles.  
- Education Level. Higher levels of education increase women's prospects in foreign policy. Educated women develop relevant knowledge and skills for analysis, negotiation, and leadership. They also gain credentials signaling competence. 
- Professional Experiences. Work experiences in law, academia, journalism, activism, and government expand women's expertise and connections. International experiences aid understanding of foreign contexts. Even unrelated jobs teach transferable skills.
- Personal Interests and Motivations. Women motivated by global affairs, cultural exchange, or social impact tend to seek foreign policy roles. Those valuing work-life balance may hesitate to take demanding positions requiring frequent travel. 
- Mentors and Sponsors. Influential individuals providing guidance, advocacy, and opportunities help women navigate institutional barriers. Access to networks of support increases women's advancement.
- Self-Confidence. Women's assertiveness, willingness to take risks, and belief in themselves shape their ambition. Lack of confidence due to cultural norms or discrimination may inhibit women from pursuing leadership.

Overall, women's personal backgrounds equip them differently for foreign policy. Tapping diverse experiences and perspectives strengthens policymaking. Reducing structural barriers allows more women to contribute their talents.

## Influence of Women in Foreign Policy 

Women have been pushing to gain more influence in foreign policy. Their increasing involvement has had several notable effects:

- **Closing the Gender Gap** - As more women take on leadership roles in foreign policy, they help close the gender gap that has long excluded women from decision-making positions. Women bring new perspectives and priorities to the table. Their presence and voices lead to more gender sensitive policies.
- **Overcoming Stereotypes and Beliefs** - Women in foreign policy must confront stereotypes that they are unqualified, overly emotional, or ill-suited for the job. But as more women excel in senior positions, they prove these stereotypes wrong and earn respect. Their successes pave the way for future women leaders.
- **Different Attitudes and Management Styles** - Women often bring different attitudes and leadership styles that can positively impact foreign policy. Research shows that women leaders tend to be more collaborative and democratic. They utilize soft power tools more. Women also seem more inclined to use negotiation over aggression. Their involvement provides balance in decision-making.

So while challenges remain, the growing influence of women in foreign policy is making the field more inclusive and sensitive to women's perspectives. Their input is reshaping priorities, attitudes and approaches.

## The Structure of FPDM Mechanism and The Problem of the Representation of Women

The decision-making process in foreign policy is conducted by specific institutions or persons in every country, considering both the external environment and internal environment. Several factors affect the formation of that country’s foreign policy, such as the subject of culture (values, traditions, opinions, and symbols); and the identity of decision-makers (ethnic, religious, political, etc.). 

People assume different roles in the society according to their gender identity. In the foreign policy arena, gender stereotypical judgments are most apparent, because it refers to a country’s preferences towards an international system based on its goals or calculation - which is dominated by masculine values.

The decision-making processes often exclude women's perspectives, as factors like culture, identity, and gender roles lead to masculine values dominating.

## Swedish Feminist Foreign Policy

Since October 2014, Sweden became the first country that applied feminist foreign policy. The feminist foreign policy applied the gender equality perspectives in response to any foreign policy issues in international politics.  

The core of Feminist Foreign Policy focused on 4R’s, such as women and girls’ rights, Representation and Resources, and also Reality. This core as an essential strategy to improve women and girl condition from discrimination and gender inequality in a whole aspect of life.

As part of the strategy of Sweden Government to pursue gender equality, there are international framework applied to strengthen their commitment, such as The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, CEDAW, UNSC RESOLUTION 1325, EU Action Plan for Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in EU (2016-2020)

## International Frameworks for Gender Equality in Foreign Policy

Gender equality in foreign policy is supported by several international frameworks and agreements. These provide guidelines and commitments that countries can adopt to strengthen women's rights and participation globally. 

### Universal Declaration of Human Rights

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the United Nations in 1948. It sets out fundamental human rights to be protected universally, including the right to equality for women and men in all spheres of life. The UDHR has inspired numerous legally binding international human rights treaties.

### Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women  

The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is an international treaty adopted in 1979 that defines discrimination against women and sets obligations to end it. 187 countries have ratified CEDAW. It mandates equal rights for women in areas including education, employment, healthcare, and family law. CEDAW has been instrumental in advancing women's rights policies worldwide.

### UN Security Council Resolution 1325

UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security was adopted in 2000. It recognizes the disproportionate impact of conflict on women and girls. It calls for women's equal participation and full involvement in peacebuilding, conflict resolution, and post-conflict reconstruction. Resolution 1325 has put gender equality issues on the agenda of the UN Security Council.

### EU Gender Equality Action Plan 

The European Union (EU) adopted the Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment: Transforming the Lives of Girls and Women through EU External Relations 2016-2020. This action plan aims to accelerate progress towards meeting international commitments on gender equality and women’s empowerment. It provides objectives and indicators to promote gender equality through the EU's external policies.

## Challenges Remaining

Despite some progress, women remain underrepresented in foreign policy globally. Many foreign ministries and diplomatic institutions are still predominantly male. There is often resistance and backlash to explicitly feminist foreign policies. Even when policies exist, translating them into meaningful change within organizations' cultures remains an ongoing struggle.  

Some key challenges that remain include:

- **Continued underrepresentation of women globally:** Women make up less than 30% of diplomats worldwide and only about 20% of ambassadors. Leadership positions are even more heavily skewed toward men. There is a persistent lack of gender parity.
- **Resistance to feminist foreign policies:** Initiatives like Sweden's feminist foreign policy have faced criticism and resistance. Some view women's empowerment as in conflict with traditional values or national interests. Others see it as Western cultural imperialism. Overcoming this resistance requires education and demonstrating benefits.
- **Need for cultural shift within institutions:** Even when policies and quotas exist on paper, actually changing the male-dominated cultures of foreign policy institutions has proven difficult. There needs to be improvement in workplace practices, attitudes, and behaviors to achieve true gender equality in diplomatic spaces.

So while the rhetoric and intentions toward greater gender equality in foreign policy have grown, significant challenges remain in translating this into reality. Greater representation, shifting cultures and attitudes, and overcoming resistance will be key priorities going forward.

## Historical Overview

The historical development of European foreign policy is characterized by periods of increasing integration interrupted by resistance to developing a unified foreign policy. 

In the post-WW2 period from 1945-1952, European integration was the product of a structural foreign policy approach. Initiatives like the Marshall Plan and the Schuman Declaration establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) laid early groundwork for integration.  

However, from 1952-1970, European integration and foreign policy became a longstanding taboo. The dominance of NATO and the transatlantic alliance led to an imbalance, overshadowing attempts at independent European foreign policy. Efforts like the proposed European Defense Community gave way to the weaker Western European Union. Even the external dimension of the EEC was limited during this period.

It was not until the 1970s that European Political Cooperation (EPC) began to bring a more unified approach to foreign policy. But progress remained slow and incremental over the following decades, with various treaties attempting to further coordination. The Maastricht Treaty established the Common Foreign and Security Policy in 1992, but its implementation remained elusive.

## The Post Cold War Context

The end of the Cold War in the early 1990s marked a dramatic shift in the global geopolitical landscape. The decades-long ideological struggle between the capitalist West and communist East came to an abrupt end with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. This brought an end to the East-West confrontation that had defined much of the post-WWII world order.

The collapse of the bipolar order required a fundamental rethinking of foreign policy on both sides. For the European Union, the post-Cold War period necessitated the creation of new foreign policy structures and capabilities detached from the NATO framework oriented around containing the Soviet threat. 

The EU struggled during this period to define its role as an autonomous global power. Lacking many traditional elements of state power like a unified military, the EU has had to rely more on its economic clout and "soft power" to exert influence on the world stage. The post-Cold War period was an uncertain time as the EU sought to forge an independent foreign policy identity in an increasingly multi-polar world.

## Globalization

Globalization has significantly impacted foreign policy. It reflects a growing predominance of economics over politics and of foreign economic relations over traditional foreign policy. As economic interdependence increases, national governments face challenges as their traditional foreign policy tools become less effective.

Globalization has both positive and negative effects on foreign policy. On the positive side, economic integration can reduce incentives for war and promote peace. However, it also leads to growing vulnerability in a burgeoning number of interrelated policy areas beyond traditional diplomacy, including the environment, public health, societal security, and more.  

The EU has positioned itself as an agent of globalization, promoting multilateralism and international institutions in an attempt to protect itself from the risks of globalization. By binding itself and its neighbors in a rules-based international system, the EU hopes to manage the complex interdependence of the modern world.

## The nature of EU Foreign Policy

The foreign policy of the EU is complex and multifaceted. It can be characterized as:

- **Multipillar** - Developed across the EU's three pillars of policy making (community pillar, justice and home affairs pillar, and common foreign and security pillar). This allows the EU to utilize a wide array of tools.
- **Multilevel** - Involves multiple levels of governance from EU institutions to member states. Allows flexibility but also potential discord between levels.
- **Multi-actor** - Numerous EU institutions and member states involved in foreign policy formulation and implementation. Requires coordination. 
- **Zero-sum and positive sum games** - FP interactions can be mutually beneficial win-win situations but also competitive zero-sum dynamics between member states or with outside actors. 

The multipillar structure gives the EU a unique and diverse policy toolkit spanning trade, aid, enlargement policy, diplomacy, and defense/security capacities. However, coordinating the pillars and actors within a coherent overarching strategy remains an ongoing challenge. The EU must balance competition and cooperation among members to forge common positions. Ultimately, an effective EU FP blends hard and soft power tools to serve shared interests.

## Energy Security

Energy security is closely tied to national security. States desire energy security in the same way that they desire military or economic security. Energy policy is inseparable from foreign policy—both producer and consumer states can no longer separate their energy policies from their foreign and security policies.  

Energy security aims to assure sufficient, reliable energy supplies at reasonable prices. Energy resources affect both producer and consumer states, as well as their objectives. For producer states, energy resources can be an instrument of foreign policy to influence consumer countries to achieve foreign policy goals. A state's national power in the energy sector depends on geographical and technological factors, economic capacity, and political decisions. Specifically, a state must have energy resources within its borders, be able to extract them economically using available technology, have the economic means to develop extraction and export, and political will to exploit the resources.

## Energy as Foreign Policy Tool

States often use energy resources as a tool or lever within their foreign policy. Energy represents a source of control for those countries capable of accessing and selling it. As a strategic national asset, energy's ability to dramatically transform the fortunes of states is clear throughout history. 

Energy-exporting states can use their resources to exert leverage over energy-importing states. By controlling the energy supply, exporters gain political influence over importers, who become dependent on continued access to energy. Exporting states may threaten to limit supplies or raise prices in order to pressure importers on foreign policy issues unrelated to energy trade.

Conversely, states that lack domestic energy resources and rely heavily on imports take serious risks in becoming dependent on foreign suppliers. Energy dependence constrains their foreign policy options and forces them to consider the supplier's interests. Import-dependent states are vulnerable to supply disruptions or price manipulation. 

Overall, the asymmetry between energy-rich and energy-poor states allows the former to use their resources as an instrument of foreign policy. Energy interdependence creates complex dynamics between exporters and importers as they balance economic interests and geopolitical leverage. Managing energy resources and flows is an essential part of foreign policy strategy.

## EU Energy Security

The EU has stressed a strong commitment to market-based approaches to external energy security. European approaches to energy security bridge three areas of debate:

- Market-based and geopolitical strategies: The EU favors market-based strategies that emphasize diversification of supplies and suppliers, whereas some view energy as a geopolitical issue requiring state intervention.  
- Relationship between energy security and producer states' governance structures: The EU links energy security to the governance structures of producer states, preferring to deal with transparent, rule-based regimes.
- The EU as an international actor: The EU's supranational nature shapes its energy security strategy. As neither an international organization nor a state, the EU has a unique approach and capabilities.

Key aspects of the EU's energy security approach include diversification of energy sources, development of renewable energy, integrated European networks, cooperation with third countries, and promoting good governance and rule of law in producer states. The EU relies more on markets than geopolitics, linking energy security to democracy and human rights in supplier states.

## The EU-Russia Energy Relationship

The EU is highly dependent on Russia for its energy needs, especially natural gas. Around 40% of the EU's imported gas comes from Russia. This dependence has shaped the EU's energy relationship with Russia in several key ways:

### Reliable Supply and Transit

- The EU is interested in a reliable supply of gas from Russia without disruptions. This means settled transit regimes through pipelines in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. 
- In the past, disputes between Russia and transit countries like Ukraine have led to gas supply disruptions in EU countries. Diversifying transit routes could increase supply security.

### Market Access and Diversification

- The EU wants independent access to Central Asian energy markets without having to rely solely on Russian-controlled pipelines. 
- Diversifying energy sources and supply routes would reduce dependence on Russia and increase the EU's energy security. This is a priority especially for newer EU members like Poland and the Baltics.

### Energy Efficiency 

- The EU has pushed Russia to prioritize energy efficiency and reduce waste. About 20% of Russian gas is lost due to outdated infrastructure.
- Greater efficiency in Russia's energy industry would help ensure stable, affordable supplies to Europe in the long run.

## Energy Policy Concerns 

States are primarily concerned with three areas when considering the role of energy in foreign policy:

**Economic Stability**

Maintaining a balance of supply and demand between energy exporting and importing states is crucial for economic stability. Disruptions in energy supply, known as "energy shocks," can wreak havoc on importer economies. As such, states aim to ensure reliable access to affordable energy sources.

**Political Leverage of Suppliers** 

Energy exporting states often wield substantial political leverage over importing states due to their dominant position as suppliers. Exporters can potentially influence the foreign policy of importers who rely heavily on their resources.

**Energy as a Tool of National Power**

States with robust energy resources benefit from the raw materials of national power. Energy can be utilized as a strategic asset or foreign policy tool. States consider how control over energy resources can be leveraged as an instrument of national power.

## Energy and National Power 

A country's national power in the energy sector is determined by several key factors:

- **Geographical Determinism** - The physical presence of energy resources like oil, natural gas, coal, etc within a state's territorial boundaries is a prerequisite for developing energy power. Without domestic resources, a state lacks direct control or sovereignty over supplies. Geography shapes options.
- **Economic Capacity** - Simply having energy reserves is not enough. A state must also possess the financial means, technology, infrastructure, and human capital to exploit resources through exploration, extraction, transportation, refining, and export. Economic strength allows states to tap their resource potential.
- **Political Will** - The political leadership of a state must make strategic decisions to develop the energy sector through investments, energy diplomacy, leveraging state-owned companies, and crafting partnerships with foreign firms. They must have the vision and willingness to use energy assets for economic and political ends. Energy policies are conscious political choices.

A combination of favorable geography, economic capacity, and political commitment is required for a state to translate its energy resources into tangible national power on the global stage. The presence of oil or gas alone does not confer energy power - many complex factors shape whether states can successfully leverage energy resources to fulfill their strategic objectives.

# The influence of Australia's Political Institutions on Foreign Policy

## Introduction

Australia's foreign policy is shaped and influenced by various political institutions and actors within the government. While the Prime Minister plays a leading role in setting the strategic agenda and vision for foreign policy, other key institutions like Cabinet, Parliament, the Foreign Minister and Trade Minister, as well as domestic groups like media and business, all contribute to and impact the foreign policymaking process and outcomes. 

At the highest level, the Prime Minister is responsible for the overall strategic direction and vision of foreign policy, and has significant influence due to their general responsibility for the government's agenda. The Foreign Affairs and Trade ministers handle more day-to-day policy and are accountable for specific functional areas. Cabinet serves as the key decision-making body that sets policy directions. Parliament influences policy through debates and committee work. Political parties also play a role in foreign policy within the parliamentary process.

Beyond government, the media and public opinion have become increasingly relevant, with governments closely following media coverage and attitudes that can impact policy. Business groups are another domestic force seeking at times to sway foreign policy decisions in line with commercial interests. All of these intersections between foreign policymaking and domestic politics demonstrate how Australia's political institutions shape the country's priorities, positions and engagement on the international stage.

## Levels of Foreign Policy Making

Foreign policy making occurs across four interrelated levels:  

**Strategic** - The strategic level deals with high-level, long-term policy goals and interests. This includes setting priorities, allocating resources, and managing complex relationships. At this level, leaders aim to advance national interests and respond to global challenges and opportunities.

**Contextual** - The contextual level focuses on the current political, economic, cultural and historical context that shapes policy options. Policymakers must understand domestic opinion, budget constraints, international commitments and other contextual factors that enable or hinder strategic goals. 

**Organizational** - The organizational level involves government institutions, processes and resources for making and implementing foreign policy decisions. This includes the organizational culture, standard operating procedures, inter-agency coordination and bureaucratic politics within government. The organizational landscape constrains policymakers' options.

**Operational** - The operational level deals with day-to-day policy implementation and crisis management. It involves applying foreign policy through diplomacy, foreign aid, military operations, intelligence activities, trade measures and other tools of statecraft. Successful foreign policy requires aligning the operational and strategic levels.

## Role of the Prime Minister

The Prime Minister plays an influential role in Australia's foreign policy by setting the strategic agenda for the government, being the main point of intersection between domestic politics and foreign policy, and having considerable freedom to decide which foreign policy issues to get involved in. 

As head of government, the Prime Minister is responsible for articulating the government's overall vision and policy priorities. This strategic agenda-setting power gives the PM significant control over foreign policy direction. The Prime Minister also connects domestic political concerns with foreign policy choices. As such, their personal interests, relationships within Cabinet, and desire to be re-elected all feed into foreign policy decisions. 

Additionally, Prime Ministers can choose the extent of their personal involvement in foreign policy matters. Unlike portfolio ministers who oversee specific policy areas, the PM is free to decide which issues warrant their time and attention. This allows the PM latitude in emphasizing certain relationships, crises, or initiatives over others. However, the PM has finite capacity and must rely substantially on foreign policy expertise and advice from other sources across government.

## Role of Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministers

The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade are responsible for day-to-day decision making at the operational level, as well as for general policy direction. The Ministers and their departments handle the bulk of foreign policy formulation and day-to-day management. This includes overseeing diplomatic missions abroad, conducting trade negotiations, and implementing foreign policy initiatives passed down from the Prime Minister and Cabinet. 

As heads of their respective departments, the Foreign Minister and Trade Minister have access to professional policy advice and established resources to carry out foreign policy. They rely heavily on input from departmental staffers, ambassadors, high commissioners, and other foreign service officers to inform policy decisions.

The Foreign Minister acts as the government's chief diplomat, engaging regularly with international counterparts. They represent Australia abroad, communicate the government's foreign policy priorities, and report back on developments overseas. The Trade Minister similarly leads trade delegations abroad and hosts foreign trade representatives domestically.

While the Prime Minister takes the lead role in shaping high-level strategy, the Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministers translate broad foreign policy visions into concrete policies and programs. They oversee diplomatic efforts and trade relationships that strengthen Australia's national interests and global standing. Their departments provide the infrastructure and personnel needed to implement foreign policy initiatives on the ground.

## Role of Cabinet

Cabinet plays a central role in Australia's foreign policy making. As the prime minister's inner circle of senior ministers, cabinet is responsible for making and coordinating key policy decisions. 

The prime minister chairs cabinet meetings, which are held regularly to set government priorities and determine foreign policy strategy. Any major foreign policy decisions must be approved by cabinet through a formal process. Relevant ministers will present detailed policy proposals for cabinet to review and decide upon.

Cabinet discussions are confidential, allowing for open debate and critique of proposals. Once a decision is made, however, cabinet ministers are expected to publicly support the government's position. This principle of collective cabinet responsibility helps present a unified front on foreign policy.

While the foreign minister takes the lead on day-to-day foreign affairs, cabinet exerts significant influence through its oversight role. The prime minister relies on cabinet backing to pursue their preferred foreign policy agenda. Significant initiatives like committing troops abroad or major trade deals require cabinet approval. Through its strategic role, cabinet shapes the direction of Australia's foreign relations.

## Role of Parliament

Parliament plays an important role in overseeing and shaping foreign policy in Australia. All international treaties must be presented to Parliament, ensuring parliamentary input on major international agreements. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties examines proposed treaty actions and can suggest amendments or additional safeguards during ratification. 

Beyond treaties, Parliament can influence foreign policy through other mechanisms. Parliamentary committees, like the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, frequently hold public inquiries on foreign policy issues. These inquiries take submissions, hold public hearings, and issue reports that recommend policy changes to government. Recently, committees have examined topics like Australia's relations with the Pacific, engagement with Asia, and defense partnerships.

Parliamentary questions and debates are additional ways MPs scrutinize and shape foreign policy. The opposition and minor parties use question time, motions, and other parliamentary devices to highlight concerns, apply political pressure, or propose alternatives on foreign affairs. Debates in the houses of Parliament contribute to public discourse and the contest of ideas around Australian foreign policy.

While the executive dominates foreign policymaking, Parliament provides oversight and plays a role in evaluating, critiquing, and refining the government's international agenda. Parliament's involvement upholds democratic accountability in the foreign policy process.

## Role of Political Parties

The major political parties in Australia - the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party (ALP) - have some differing approaches when it comes to foreign policy, though there is also significant overlap. 

The Liberal Party, which is the current party in government, tends to take a pragmatic approach focused on Australia's national interests. They promote strong ties with traditional allies like the United States and emphasize trade relationships in the Asia-Pacific region. The Liberals are generally supportive of Australia's alliance with the US and its involvement in military operations led by the US, though there can be debate within the party on these issues.

The ALP is the other major party in Australia. On foreign policy, Labor has traditionally focused on engagement with Asia, the United Nations, and multilateralism. They are more reluctant about military deployments than the Liberals. However, in practice, Labor governments have still maintained the US alliance and supported military operations alongside the US and other allies at times. There are diverse views within the ALP on foreign policy issues.

While the two major parties have differences in outlook, in practice there is often bipartisan agreement or compromise on major foreign policy decisions involving trade, defense, and international relationships. However, partisan debate can arise over more controversial issues like participating in specific military operations proposed by the US. Overall, foreign policy is shaped through a complex interplay of perspectives from the government, opposition, and diverse views within each party.

## Influence of Media

The media plays an influential role in Australian foreign policy as a conduit of information and attitudes to the public and policymakers. The major Australian media outlets in print, television, radio and online news - such as News Corp Australia, Nine Entertainment Co., Seven West Media and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) - have significant reach, despite being controlled by a relatively small number of private and public organizations. 

The media's power derives from its position as a primary channel through which information and perspectives on international affairs reach the Australian public and leadership. This enables the media to shape perceptions and narratives surrounding foreign policy issues. Governments closely monitor domestic media coverage of foreign policy decisions and international events to gauge public opinion.

Through investigative journalism, opinion columns and editorials, the Australian media scrutinizes government foreign policy and provides analysis. Media narratives surrounding international events and foreign policy issues can sway public discourse and pressure policymakers. However, the media has limits in directly setting the foreign policy agenda. Overall, the Australian media has an indirect yet influential role in foreign policy through shaping the climate in which decisions are made.

## Influence of Business Groups

Business groups and individual business leaders aim to influence Australian foreign policy, especially on issues that impact trade and investment interests. Rather than engaging in public advocacy or debate, businesses prefer private lobbying and representations to the government. 

This allows businesses to promote specific policy positions or outcomes through direct relationships with politicians and diplomatic missions. Major companies often have dedicated government relations teams focused on shaping policies relevant to the business.

Former politicians and diplomatic officials are sometimes hired to access their networks and provide insights into policymaking processes. Businesses try to leverage these connections to relay perspectives on trade agreements, market access, investment protections, visa arrangements and other priorities.  

By shaping views internally, businesses hope to sway external policies in their favor. Their advocacy tends to be on specific issues where commercial interests are at stake, rather than involvement in broader strategic debates. Still, through private influence, business groups shape parts of the foreign policy agenda.

## Key Foreign Policy Issues

Australia's foreign policy is shaped by its response to key issues that impact the country's interests and values. Several major foreign policy issues have been prominent in recent years:

### Terrorism

The threat of terrorism has been a major concern for Australia since the September 11 attacks in the United States. Australian troops have fought alongside the U.S. and allies in Afghanistan and Iraq with the stated goal of combatting terrorism. Domestically, Australia has passed controversial security laws that expand police and intelligence powers. Balancing security and civil liberties has been an ongoing challenge.

### Iraq and Afghanistan Wars

Australia contributed troops to both the Iraq War starting in 2003 and the Afghanistan War starting in 2001. The commitment to these unpopular wars was controversial domestically. Critics argued the wars were illegal, increased the terrorism threat, and resulted in a diversion of resources from more pressing strategic issues in Australia's neighborhood. Defenders argued the wars were necessary to support the U.S. alliance and advance democracy.  

### Climate Change 

Climate change poses a major threat to Australia due to the country's vulnerability to impacts like sea level rise, drought, bushfires, and coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. Addressing climate change has been contentious politically. Australia initially adopted carbon pricing under Labor but this was repealed by the Liberal government. The issue remains divisive.

### The U.S. Alliance

The U.S. alliance has been the bedrock of Australia's foreign policy since World War 2. However, changes in relative U.S. power and the rise of China have led to debates about whether Australia should balance its alliance with greater engagement in Asia. Managing tensions between the U.S. and China will be a key challenge. The treatment of the U.S. alliance impacts domestic politics.

<exercise id="6" title="U.S. Foreign Policy">    

## Introduction

US foreign policy has evolved considerably since the country's founding, shaped by changing geopolitical realities, values, and domestic politics. But some key goals have remained relatively constant - to protect the homeland, promote economic prosperity, and uphold democratic principles abroad. 

In the 19th century, foreign policy was focused inward - on westward expansion and avoiding entanglements in European affairs. This isolationism shifted after the Spanish-American war, with the US emerging as a global power. In the 20th century, the US assumed a leadership role in WWI and WWII, then engaged in a global Cold War struggle against communism. 

After the Cold War, policymakers debated America's role in the post-Soviet world. The Clinton administration focused on open markets, democracy promotion, and multilateral engagement. After 9/11, counterterrorism became the top priority under President Bush. More recently, the US has aimed to pivot toward Asia while grappling with crises in the Middle East.

Looking ahead, US foreign policy will continue to balance interests in security, prosperity, and principles. But it will also have to adapt to new challenges - from climate change to pandemics to digital threats. America's global leadership role remains contested, as the international landscape grows more multipolar.

## Power

Power is an essential element of foreign policy. It refers to a nation's capacity to use its resources to influence or control other states. Power allows a country to protect and advance its national interests on the global stage.  

There are several types of power in foreign policy:

- Military power involves a nation's armed forces, weapons capabilities, and ability to project force globally. Military power remains vital for self-defense and deterring aggression. The United States maintains the world's largest military budget and most advanced capabilities.
- Economic power stems from a large, innovative economy and influences global trade and investment flows. The U.S. has the world's largest economy and dollar trade gives it financial power. Economic sanctions are a key foreign policy tool.
- Technological power from inventions and innovations creates advantages in communications, information, aerospace, and other spheres. U.S. technological strength stems from robust research and development.
- Soft power arises from the appeal of a nation's culture, values, policies and institutions. U.S. entertainment, brands, universities and support for democracy enhance its soft power.

A foreign policy with diverse power resources allows flexibility in how a nation advances its interests. Power underpins the ability to reward partners, deter adversaries and shape the global order.

## Self-Defense

A state's power is critical for the fundamental goal of self-defense and control of its territory. Power capabilities such as a strong military enable a nation to deter or defeat aggressors who may threaten the country's sovereignty or safety. Power also allows a state to secure its borders and maintain territorial integrity. 

Without adequate power, a nation is vulnerable to external threats and unable to prevent violation of its borders or encroachment on its land and resources. The ability to defend one's territory from invasion or occupation is essential for survival as an independent state.

Power provides the strength and capacity for a country to protect its homeland, citizens, and possessions against potential attacks or seizure by hostile forces. This defensive capacity is vital given an anarchic international system lacking a supreme authority able to protect the sovereignty of states. Self-defense requires powerful military, economic, and diplomatic capabilities to counter dangers from would-be aggressors.

A nation's power and self-defense abilities also enable it to deter potential adversaries from even contemplating threatening actions. When a state has formidable defense capacities, rivals will think twice before contemplating military action, reducing chances of attack. Power is thus a critical prerequisite for self-defense as well as deterrence of aggressors, upholding sovereignty and territorial integrity.

## Prosperity

Principally in economic terms, prosperity focuses on goals related to the American economy:

- Provide reliable and low-cost imports of commodities, raw materials, agricultural produce, and industrial goods that are crucial to the economy. If key imports were cut off or became much more expensive, major sectors of the economy would suffer.
- Obtain growing markets for American exports because exports are major sources of jobs for US workers and profits for US companies. Because the U.S. economy is already so large and self-sufficient, the percentage of GDP that derives from trade outside the United States is not as great as for most other nations; nevertheless, exports have grown rapidly. The search for foreign markets for American goods is central to the prosperity goal. 
- Gain access to profitable foreign investments where American capital can obtain a good return. The ability of US firms to invest abroad and the freedom to transfer the economic returns from those investments back home are directly linked to prosperity.
- Assure international economic opportunities and in general facilitate the international flow of goods, services, and capital for the benefit of the American economy. This is the broadest conception of the economic goal. Sometimes it is expressed as maintaining and expanding an “open” world economy that is hospitable to US commerce and in which American needs and desires remain essentially unimpeded by the hindrances that could result from economic nationalism abroad or international upheavals.

## Principles

The Principles component of US foreign policy refers to the values, ideals, and beliefs that the United States has claimed to stand for in the world. These principles are rooted in the political values on which America was founded - namely, freedom, democracy, individual rights, and the rule of law. Throughout history, US leaders have invoked these principles to justify America's role in the world and its relationships with other nations.

Some key principles that have shaped US foreign policy include:

- Promoting democracy and human rights - The US has often argued that spreading democracy globally aligns with its founding values and enhances global stability and peace. This principle has been used to guide policies from the Cold War to the War on Terror.
- Upholding liberal international order - The US was a key architect of institutions like the UN, NATO, and WTO that make up the liberal rules-based international order. The US cites commitment to this order as a reason for global engagement.
- Respect for national sovereignty - While the US promotes democracy globally, it also claims to respect national sovereignty and rejects interference in other nation's internal affairs. However, it has violated this principle at times.
- Advancing global justice - The US argues its foreign policy aims to advance ideals like human dignity, social justice, and human rights globally. Critics argue this masks self-interest.

While principles set a vision for US foreign policy, realpolitik interests in power and security often dominate decision making. But principles provide an ideological framework for US global leadership. Most administrations have tried balancing principles with other policy goals and interests.

## Democratic Idealism

Promoting democracy worldwide has been a central principle of U.S. foreign policy. This commitment to spreading democracy stems from the belief that democratic governments better protect human rights, are more trusting of their neighbors, and are more cooperative and reliable partners for the United States. 

The origins of democratic idealism trace back to President Woodrow Wilson, who emphasized "self-determination" for all people and believed the United States had a moral responsibility to promote democracy globally. During the Cold War, the United States framed its opposition to communism and the Soviet Union as a battle between freedom and authoritarianism. Promoting democracy was both a moral cause and a means to contain Soviet expansion.

In recent decades, presidents from both parties have continued to advocate for democracy promotion. President Clinton asserted that "democratic enlargement" would advance security and prosperity. President George W. Bush made democratization a centerpiece of his national security strategy after 9/11, believing that spreading democracy would help defeat militant Islamism. President Obama emphasized engaging with and strengthening civil society. Though approaches have varied, promoting democracy endures as a bipartisan objective.

Critics argue that embracing democratization too zealously can breed resentment and instability. Imposing democracy through regime change or force rarely succeeds. Yet, administrations across ideologies have maintained that, done judiciously, advancing human rights and democratic ideals overseas serves U.S. interests and global peace.

## Foreign Policy Process 

The foreign policy process in the United States involves various branches of government, interest groups, media outlets, and public opinion. Understanding how these different actors influence foreign policy decisions is key.

### The President

The president plays a central role in making and carrying out foreign policy. As commander-in-chief of the armed forces, chief diplomat, and head of state, the president has considerable power and influence over foreign affairs. 

However, the president's ability to pursue their preferred foreign policy is constrained by other factors. Congress can block treaties and must approve declarations of war. The president also relies on federal agencies like the State Department to implement policy.

### Congress

The Constitution grants Congress several foreign policy powers, including declaring war, approving treaties and ambassadors, and appropriating funds. In practice, presidents take the lead on most foreign policy matters.

Still, Congress exerts influence through oversight hearings, legislation, and control of the budget. Divided government, when the president's party does not control Congress, can increase inter-branch tensions over foreign policy.

### Interest Groups

Various interest groups try to shape US foreign policy to serve their particular interests. These include ethnic lobbies, human rights organizations, defense contractors, big businesses, and other groups.

Their influence depends on factors like financial resources, grassroots support, access to policymakers, and how much their goals align with the administration's agenda.

### Media

The news media plays an agenda-setting role in foreign policy. Media coverage of international events and issues can pressure policymakers to take certain actions. But the media's impact is filtered through how policymakers interpret the facts.

### Public Opinion

Public opinion provides broad input to policymakers about the nation's priorities and mood. But most foreign policy issues do not directly affect citizens' daily lives. As a result, public opinion tends to be general in nature rather than detailed policy prescriptions.

Foreign policymakers balance public opinion with other considerations like national interests and geopolitics when making decisions. But substantial public opposition can constrain policy options.

## Executive Branch

The president plays the most significant role in foreign policymaking within the executive branch. While the Constitution specifies that the president has the power to receive ambassadors and, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties and appoint ambassadors and other ministers and consuls, presidents have long claimed broad powers to act independently, especially in times of crisis. 

The president's formal powers provide substantial capacity to shape U.S. foreign policy, but they are not unlimited. The Constitution grants Congress the sole authority to declare war. The Senate must approve all major international agreements and key executive branch appointments. The appropriations process gives Congress immense influence over foreign policy. Nevertheless, presidents have cited their constitutionally granted executive powers to justify broad unilateral policymaking authority in foreign affairs, especially concerning the use of force abroad.

The president stands at the apex of the foreign policy bureaucracy and has great influence in directing its work. The State Department, led by the secretary of state, is home to the government's foreign policy experts. It seeks to implement the president's foreign policy goals through diplomacy. The Department of Defense oversees the nation's armed forces and is led by the secretary of defense. The intelligence community, including the CIA, provides intelligence information to inform policymaking. Numerous other departments and agencies are involved in foreign affairs and impacted by presidential directives.

While Congress and other actors influence foreign policy, the president sits at the center of the foreign policymaking process. The president's unique role gives them more power to shape U.S. foreign policy than any other single individual.

## Legislative Branch

Congress plays a key role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. The Senate must ratify all treaties by a two-thirds supermajority vote. The Senate also must confirm all major ambassadorial and cabinet appointments that deal with foreign policy matters. 

Additionally, Congress holds several foreign policy powers, including:

- The power to regulate international commerce
- The power to declare war
- The power to fund and oversee the military
- Oversight over the intelligence agencies and covert operations
- The Senate's "advice and consent" role over treaties and appointments

In practice, Congress tends to defer to the President on routine foreign policy matters. However, Congress has asserted its authority at times, such as blocking arms sales or imposing sanctions. When the President and Congress clash over foreign policy, tensions and compromise between the two branches often emerge. As public opinion and partisan control of government shifts, the relative balance of power between the executive and legislative branches continues to evolve.

<exercise id="7" title="Japan Foreign Policy">    


# Introduction

Foreign policy making in Japan is a contentious process that involves various institutional and ideational factors. The weak position of the prime minister vis-à-vis fragmented sub-governments, the nexus between politicians, bureaucrats, and businesspeople, and the existence of powerful veto players are some of the institutional constraints that put into question the prime minister's and foreign minister's abilities to exert leadership in a top-down manner. 

On the other hand, the antimilitary social norms and culture, stemming from the traumatic history of the country, are considered by constructivists as dominant domestic factors behind Tokyo's pacifist security policy. The study of foreign policy making in Japan also highlights the impact of central government reforms on the balance of power in foreign policy making.

# The Actor's Behind Japan's Foreign Policy

The study of foreign policy making in Japan suggests that the power struggles between three key actors, namely **the Kantei (prime minister and his or her closest entourage), MOFA officials, and ruling party backbenchers**, are significant factors behind foreign policy making in Japan. 

**The Kantei** appeared to be a coherent actor, but in reality, most of its administrative staff recruited from and represented the interests of separate ministries. 

**MOFA** was an even less homogenous institution, with distinct regional bureaus and divisions pursuing their sectional goals. 

**The ruling party** constituted the least coherent of the three actors, with parliamentary tribes promoting contradictory interests. The power of MOFA bureaucrats and their unwillingness to change the status quo have been cited as one of the reasons for the exceptional stability of Japan’s foreign policy in the postwar period. 

The study also highlights the impact of central government reforms on the balance of power in foreign policy making, which strengthened the position of the prime minister and his or her closest entourage, but the politicians in the government were far from given a free hand in conducting diplomacy in a top-down manner.

# External Factors That Influence Japan's Foreign Policy Making

External factors, such as the bipolar nature of the international system during the Cold War, Sino-American rapprochement in the 1970s, power shifts after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the evolving dynamics of the post-Cold War era, have significantly influenced Japan's foreign and security policies. 

However, these systemic pressures translated into concrete decisions in Japan's foreign policy only after being filtered through the biased perceptions of statespersons, ideological and factional cleavages in the ruling parties, bureaucracy-led administrative structures, or constraints stemming from the "pacifist" Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution. 

The study emphasizes that while external incentives set the general contour of Japan's behavior on the international scene, they were significantly influenced by contextual domestic-level factors, such as the complexity of decision-making mechanisms, the weak position of the prime minister vis-à-vis fragmented subgovernments, and the nexus between politicians, bureaucrats, and businesspeople. 

### Economic Factors

Global economic trends can significantly affect Japan's foreign policy making. For example, Japan's economic interests in the Asia-Pacific region have led to its active participation in regional economic integration initiatives, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Japan's foreign policy has also been influenced by its economic relations with China and the United States, two of its largest trading partners.

# Central Government Reforms And Foreign Policy Making In Japan

Central government reforms in Japan have significantly impacted foreign policy making in the country. The administrative reform, conceived and drafted by Prime Minister Hashimoto Ryutaro in 1996–1998 and implemented under the Mori Yoshiro administration in January 2001, aimed to strengthen the position of the prime minister vis-à-vis bureaucrats and enhance his or her control over separate ministries. 

The central government reforms provided more power to the Kantei (prime minister's office) in order to overcome sectional frictions and enhance the prime minister's control over separate ministries. 

# War on Terrorism

During the Koizumi cabinet, Japan's response to the events of 9/11 was not the result of U.S. pressure, but rather the political leanings and convictions of the prime minister. Koizumi set up a liaison office at the Emergency Operation Center to gather information and later declared a War on Terrorism. 

He emphasized that Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) would not cooperate in America's military operations but would participate in cooperation efforts as a member of the international community. Koizumi presented the government's policy to strongly support the United States, framing the issue in terms of national interest and claiming to respect Article 9. 

He wanted Japan to assume an "honorable position" in the international community by preparing a cooperation and support system for the United States and other states engaged in the War on Terrorism. The policies adopted under the Koizumi cabinet, including the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law, the Emergency Law, and the Law Concerning the Special Measures for Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq, were related to the Japan–U.S. security alliance, and Koizumi's strong leadership and effective policy priorities were evident during his term in office.

# Historical Problem

During the Koizumi administration, history problems caused a significant deterioration in Japan's relations with China and South Korea. The prime minister's obstinate yearly visits to the Yasukuni Shrine and the failure to address concerns over Japanese history textbooks led to anti-Japanese sentiments in these countries. 

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) bureaucrats, concerned about the impact of history problems on diplomacy, tried to convince the prime minister to stop visiting Yasukuni. Even some of Koizumi's closest associates, such as Chief Cabinet Secretary Fukuda Yasuo, advocated for a more accommodative stance towards neighboring countries. The contentious nature of Japanese diplomacy was revealed both in the Kantei–MOFA–ruling party triangle and within the ruling party itself. 

Koizumi's unyielding posture on history problems was partly attributed to his nationalistic endeavors and his desire to approach right-wing politicians. This stance, however, led to antagonism with the influential group of moderate lawmakers in the ruling party. The history problems under the Koizumi administration highlighted the internal contention within the Japanese government and the challenges of addressing delicate historical issues in the context of foreign policy.

### Yasukuni Shrine

The Yasukuni Shrine is a Shinto shrine located in Yasukuni, Japan, and is dedicated to the enshrined spirits of the Japanese military personnel who died during the war. The shrine has been a subject of controversy and debate, particularly due to its association with Japan's past military activities and the potential implications for regional relations. During the Koizumi cabinet, the prime minister's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine in August 2006 sparked protests from neighboring countries, such as China and South Korea, who viewed the visit as a violation of their countries' sovereignty rights and an affront to their efforts to promote reconciliation and cooperation in the region
   
Japan's initial reaction to pressure from China and South Korea was marked by a complex process of decision-making and internal debates. When Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited the Yasukuni Shrine in August 2006, he faced opposition from both Chinese and South Korean governments, which viewed the visit as a violation of their countries' sovereignty rights and an affront to their efforts to promote reconciliation and cooperation in the region. 

The Japanese government's response to the pressure from China and South Korea was influenced by various factors, including domestic politics, bureaucratic interests, and the prime minister's personal convictions. For instance, Prime Minister Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine was partly driven by his nationalistic endeavors and his desire to approach right-wing politicians. 

The Japanese government's initial reaction to the pressure from China and South Korea also highlighted the internal contention within the Japanese government and the challenges of addressing delicate historical issues in the context of foreign policy. For example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) bureaucrats, concerned about the impact of history issues on diplomacy, tried to convince the prime minister to stop visiting Yasukuni. However, Koizumi's personal convictions and his desire to approach right-wing politicians led him to continue with his plans. 

In summary, Japan's initial reaction to pressure from China and South Korea was a complex process influenced by various factors, including domestic politics, bureaucratic interests, and the prime minister's personal convictions. The response highlighted the internal contention within the Japanese government and the challenges of addressing delicate historical issues in the context of foreign policy.

### Suspension Of Contacts With China At The End Of Koizumi Administration

At the end of the Koizumi administration, there was a suspension of contacts with China due to several factors. One of the key factors was the suspension of the China-Japan high-level meetings in 2006, which were initially scheduled to be held in July but were postponed due to the Japanese government's lack of progress in addressing Chinese concerns over the Yasukuni Shrine visits and other history-related issues. 

The suspension of high-level meetings between Japan and China was a significant event, as it indicated a deterioration in bilateral relations. The Chinese government expressed disappointment and frustration over Japan's failure to address their concerns, leading to the postponement of the meetings. This decision was a clear sign of the impact of history issues on Japan's foreign policy and the challenges of managing relations with neighboring countries.

The suspension of contacts with China also highlighted the internal contention within the Japanese government and the difficulties in addressing delicate historical issues in the context of foreign policy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) bureaucrats, concerned about the impact of history issues on diplomacy, tried to convince the prime minister to stop visiting Yasukuni. However, Koizumi's personal convictions and his desire to approach right-wing politicians led him to continue with his plan.

### Rapprochement With China

Under the Abe and Fukuda Cabinets, there were efforts to improve relations with China, which had been strained due to historical issues and territorial disputes. In 2006, Prime Minister Abe Shinzo visited China and held talks with Chinese leaders, signaling a thaw in bilateral relations. The two countries agreed to establish a "mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests" and to work together on regional and global issues. The Fukuda Cabinet continued this trend, with Prime Minister Fukuda Yasuo visiting China in 2007 and signing a joint statement with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, which emphasized the importance of dialogue and cooperation between the two countries. The statement also addressed the issue of historical disputes, stating that the two countries would "face history squarely and advance towards the future" and work towards building a "strategic, mutually beneficial relationship based on common interests".

The rapprochement with China under the Abe and Fukuda Cabinets was a significant development in Japan's foreign policy, as it signaled a shift towards a more cooperative and constructive relationship with China. The efforts to improve relations were driven by a recognition of the importance of China as a regional and global power, as well as a desire to address historical issues and territorial disputes in a peaceful and constructive manner.

# East Asian Community

The East Asian Community (EAC) initiative was first proposed by then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in 2003 as a means to foster closer economic and political ties among Japan, China, and South Korea. The idea behind the EAC was to create a regional community that would promote cooperation in various areas, such as trade, investment, and security, and ultimately lead to a more stable and prosperous region. The initiative was seen as a response to the growing economic influence of China and South Korea, which were rapidly emerging as major regional powers.

The EAC initiative was driven by the recognition of the importance of these countries as significant regional and global players, as well as a desire to address historical issues and territorial disputes in a peaceful and constructive manner. However, the initiative faced several challenges, including opposition from some members of the Japanese government, concerns about the potential impact on existing alliances and security arrangements, and the lack of a clear roadmap for implementing the EAC.

## Kan Naoto and the end of EAC

According to the provided document, the EAC initiative faced challenges during the Kan Naoto administration, which ultimately led to its end. The EAC initiative was initially proposed by Prime Minister Koizumi in 2003 as a means to foster closer economic and political ties among Japan, China, and South Korea. However, the initiative faced several challenges, including opposition from some members of the Japanese government, concerns about the potential impact on existing alliances and security arrangements, and the lack of a clear roadmap for implementing the EAC.

During the Kan Naoto administration, the EAC initiative faced further challenges, including the global financial crisis and the Fukushima nuclear disaster, which diverted attention and resources away from the initiative. Additionally, there were concerns about the potential impact of the EAC on Japan's existing alliances and security arrangements, particularly with the United States. As a result, the Kan administration shifted its focus towards strengthening Japan's existing alliances and partnerships, rather than pursuing the EAC initiative.

In summary, the EAC initiative faced challenges during the Kan Naoto administration, which ultimately led to its end. The initiative faced opposition from some members of the Japanese government, concerns about the potential impact on existing alliances and security arrangements, and the lack of a clear roadmap for implementation. Additionally, the global financial crisis and the Fukushima nuclear disaster diverted attention and resources away from the initiative, and there were concerns about its potential impact on Japan's existing alliances and partnerships.
