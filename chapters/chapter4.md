## Introduction to Politics

Politics refers to activities associated with governance and decision-making of groups of people. At its core, politics involves the use of power and authority to impact society. 

The term "politics" originates from the Greek word "politika" which means "affairs of the cities". It refers to the art or science of organizing and governing societies.

Politics involves the creation and operations of governments, political parties, organizations, legislations, policies and negotiations between varied interest groups. It is about how power is distributed and decisions are made in societies.

The purpose of politics is to address issues faced by societies and organize collective efforts towards shared goals that improve lives. It enables social coordination and decision-making to determine how limited resources are allocated, which programs are implemented and whose interests are served. 

Politics is intricately linked to the possession of power, which is the ability to influence people and events. Power dynamics are central in political activities, which aim to create, distribute, exercise and constrain power in acceptable ways.

At its core, politics is about actualizing the ideals of fairness, justice, security and development in societies through governance, policy making and collective decision-making. It serves the purpose of organizing social life and navigating societies towards the greater good.

## History and Origin of Political Science

Political science emerged as a distinct field of study in the 19th century, developing alongside other social sciences like sociology, anthropology, economics, and psychology. These new fields arose in response to the social and political changes brought about by the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, and the rise of liberal democracy. 

Several key thinkers helped establish political science as a modern academic discipline. Alexis de Tocqueville, often called the founder of political science, wrote extensively on democracy in America in the 1830s. Other influential early political scientists included John Stuart Mill, who explored ideas of representative government and utilitarianism in the mid-19th century.

German scholars also made major contributions to the new field of political science. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel developed a dialectical theory of the state, while Max Weber wrote on bureaucracy and authority. The German university model, emphasizing research and academic freedom, shaped political science methodology.

As political science developed into an established social science, it both influenced and was shaped by related disciplines. Insights from economics and sociology informed the study of political institutions and processes. Meanwhile, political science contributed theories on civic participation, voting behavior, and the role of the state. 

By the early 20th century, political science was a thriving field at many universities, marked by an empirical, data-driven approach. Pioneering scholars like Harold Lasswell and Charles Merriam helped systematize the study of politics and define it as an independent discipline. Political science associations were also founded to promote the field's growth.

While political science has ancient roots in philosophy, its origins as a modern social science date back just over 150 years. Its emergence was driven by political change and cross-fertilization with other developing social science disciplines in the 19th century. Political science continues evolving today, expanding its interdisciplinary scope while building on its core mission of studying politics and power.

## Core Concepts 

The state is the fundamental element of political science, characterized by territory, population, government, and sovereignty. The state exercises authority over its territory and the people residing within it through established institutions. These institutions include the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Through these governing bodies, the state makes and enforces laws, provides services, and regulates society. The relations between the state and its citizens involve the social contract where citizens accept state authority in return for order, security and the provision of public goods. The purpose of the state is to promote the public interest and common good of its people. However, the state also maintains a monopoly on the legitimate use of force to compel citizens to adhere to its laws. Therefore a tension exists between citizens wanting freedom from state intrusion, while the state aims to maintain order and stability through laws and enforcement. The ideal is for the state to strike the right balance between authority and liberty. Overall the state, its institutions and relations with citizens are key components of political science and the study of governance.

## Power

Power is the ability to influence the actions of others. It is the essence of politics according to political scientists who view politics as the activities related to the pursuit and maintenance of power. 

### Definition

Power refers to the capacity to make others do what they otherwise would not have done. It involves overcoming obstacles and resistance to achieve desired outcomes. Power is exercised through various means like force, coercion, manipulation, persuasion, inducement, lobbying, and authority.

### Types

There are different types and classifications of power:

- Hard power relies on military intervention, threats, and economic sanctions to exert control.
- Soft power depends on attraction and persuasion to get others to do what you want. 
- Compulsory power forces people to do something against their will through threats or physical force.
- Institutional power operates through hierarchies, rules, and standard procedures of organizations.
- Structural power shapes the contexts in which others make decisions.

### Sources 

The sources of power include:

- Control of resources needed by others
- Ability to administer punishment or reward
- Charismatic appeal and interpersonal skills 
- Formal authority from holding an office or position
- Control of decision-making processes
- Possession of information, knowledge and expertise

### Pursuit and Maintenance of Power

The pursuit and maintenance of power are central goals in politics. Political actors seek to gain, retain and expand power through various strategies:

- Forming alliances and networks
- Controlling communication and managing public perception
- Offering incentives and patronage
- Appealing to identities and values  
- Using rhetoric and framing issues effectively
- Developing a strong support base

Power dynamics aim to serve broader societal interests, even as competing groups struggle to advance their own agendas and priorities. The outcomes depend on the relative power of stakeholders.

## Political Science

Political science is the study of politics or the process of governance. It explores how societies organize collective life in order to navigate towards the "good life." The study of political science emerged in the 19th century, developing alongside other social science disciplines like sociology, anthropology, economics, and psychology. However, the practice and examination of political life has existed since ancient times, with roots in philosophy. 

Political science examines the systems and institutions that allow societies to make collective decisions. This includes the study of governments, public policies, political processes, systems of power, and civic engagement. At its core, political science is concerned with how societies tackle issues of public concern and ensure the wellbeing of citizens through collective efforts.

Some key aspects studied within political science include:

- Political institutions - The structures and functions of governments, legislatures, courts, bureaucracies and more. This explores how these institutions operate and interact.
- Political behavior - How individuals and groups influence political processes and outcomes through voting, activism, law-making and more. 
- Public policy - The development, enactment and analysis of government policies on issues like healthcare, education, transportation and more.
- Political theory - The history of political thought and ideologies that have shaped governance systems.
- Comparative politics - The analysis and comparison of political institutions, processes and policies across different countries. 
- International relations - The interactions between nation states, inter-governmental organizations, non-state actors and more at the global level.

The study of political science provides insights into the issues societies grapple with and the solutions they develop through governance systems. It aims to shed light on the forces that shape collective decision-making. Political science scholarship also enables citizens to better understand public affairs, equipping them to participate actively in civic life. Overall, political science plays a vital role in building knowledge to improve governance, public policy and civic engagement.

## Decision-Making 

The decision-making process is central to politics. It involves collective decision-making and the formulation of public policies that affect society as a whole. Decisions are the outcomes of choosing among alternative options. Decision-making is a process that leads to reaching a decision. In the context of politics, decision-making relates to decisions that are collectively binding and involve determining the goals of society and the policies to achieve them.

Decision-making in politics is a collective process that aims to determine the public good. Political actors and institutions engage in decision-making on behalf of the people and make choices that shape society. This collective decision-making requires bridging different interests and values in society to arrive at mutually acceptable decisions. 

At the core of political decision-making is the formulation of public policy. Public policy refers to the exercise of power by political actors or groups to choose goals and strategies to achieve those goals. It emphasizes that societies have shared objectives that require collective efforts and the establishment of binding plans, which are reflected in public policies implemented by authorities. 

The policy formulation process involves identifying policy issues and problems, formulating policy proposals, analyzing policy alternatives, selecting policy options, implementing public policy, and evaluating policy outcomes. This complex process aims to address societal needs and demands through deliberate governmental action. The choices involved have distributional consequences on who gets what in society.

Effective policy making relies on considering facts, values, impacts, and politics. It requires evidence-based analysis to inform decisions. Values shape what goals are deemed proper for society. Understanding potential impacts allows anticipating policy consequences. Managing politics and building consensus enables collectively binding decisions that serve the public interest. 

In summary, political decision-making and policy formulation are at the core of determining societal goals and how to achieve them. It is a complex process of collective choice-making that shapes the public good.

## Public Policy

Public policy refers to the exercise of power by political actors or groups to choose goals and strategies to achieve those goals. It emphasizes that societies have shared objectives that require collective efforts and the establishment of binding plans, which are reflected in public policies implemented by authorities. 

Public policy involves the exercise of power to determine the goals of society and formulate strategies to achieve them. It highlights that societies have common aims that necessitate joint initiatives. These communal purposes are embodied in public policies enacted and executed by the government.

The formulation of public policy is a complex process that analyzes societal problems, weighs alternative solutions, and selects the best course of action. It entails identifying issues, gathering information, assessing options, choosing policy instruments, and implementing decisions. The policy cycle includes issue emergence, agenda setting, policy formulation, adoption, implementation, and evaluation. 

Some key aspects of the public policy process include:

- Defining the problem - What exactly is the problem or issue being addressed? This involves research and analysis.
- Setting goals and objectives - What does society hope to achieve through this policy? Goals provide direction.
- Identifying alternative solutions - What are the different options to address the problem? Their costs and benefits must be examined.
- Analyzing the alternatives - Which option best achieves the goals with the optimal tradeoff between costs and benefits? 
- Selecting the preferred policy - The best alternative is formally chosen and adopted.
- Implementing the policy - The government enforces and administers the policy.
- Evaluating results - How effective was the policy? Did it achieve the desired outcomes?

Public policy is a complex sociopolitical process centered on the exercise of power to determine collective goals and the strategies to accomplish them through government action. It converts society's needs into binding decisions that shape public life.

## Distribution of Power  

The distribution and allocation of power involves the division and allocation of values within society. Politics is the mechanism by which values are distributed and allocated. Values refer to the things that members of a society desire, which can include material goods, personal wellbeing, security, freedom, and equality.

Political power allows certain individuals or groups to influence how these values are divided and given out in a society. Those with more power are able to allocate values in a way that benefits themselves, even if it comes at the expense of other groups. This unequal distribution often leads to conflicts as disadvantaged groups will resist unfair allocations that deprive them of values they believe they deserve or need. 

Groups and individuals without political power have little say in how values are distributed. They lack the ability to ensure they receive their fair share, or to rectify allocations they see as unjust. Even basic values like security, food, shelter, and healthcare may be lacking for those with minimal power. This imbalance underscores how vital the distribution of power is in determining quality of life.

Examining the relationship between political power, government policy, and the unequal distribution of values is crucial. Questions of who gets what, how much they get, and the fairness of allocations lie at the heart of politics. Political science analyzes how resources are divided and the conflicts that erupt when segments of society feel they are being denied values rightfully owed to them. Only by studying the connections between power and inequality can effective public policies be created that balance the distribution of values across all groups within a society.

## Aspects of Political Science

Political science encompasses various aspects that shape the field:

### Political Theory

Political theory involves the study of systematic and generalized political ideas and phenomena. It examines the history of political thought and the development of political concepts and ideologies over time. Key areas of focus include political philosophy, political culture, and political consciousness. Political theorists analyze foundational texts, ideas, and thinkers that have influenced the evolution of politics.

### Political Institutions 

The study of political institutions examines the structures and processes of government and politics. This includes the constitution, the functions and powers of government branches, the role of bureaucracies, and the socio-economic impacts of political institutions. Scholars analyze how institutions emerge and evolve, their functions, dysfunctions, and how they distribute power.

### Political Parties and Groups

This area explores political parties, interest groups, social movements, and civil society organizations. It looks at how these groups form, recruit members, mobilize resources, influence policymaking, and impact political outcomes. The dynamics between parties and groups is also examined, including cooperation, conflict, and competition for power.

### Public Opinion

Public opinion is the collection of views of ordinary citizens regarding politics, policy, and politicians. Scholars study how opinions form, change, and the role they play in politics. This relies heavily on concepts from psychology and sociology. Public opinion polling and surveys are important tools for measuring opinions.

### International Relations

International relations examines politics at the global level, including relations between countries, role of international organizations, global governance, and transnational issues. Key focuses include foreign policymaking, international law and norms, conflict and cooperation between countries, and comparative politics.

## Role of Government

Government is the organization that makes, enforces, and implements political decisions for a society. It plays a central role in politics through its core functions:

- **Rule-making**: Governments make rules in the form of laws, policies, regulations, and programs that are binding on members of society. The legislature enacts bills that reflect the goals and values of society. These become enforceable laws. Governments also make rules through executive orders, policies, and regulations.

- **Rule execution**: Once rules are made, the executive branch implements them by building institutions and processes. It delivers services, enforces laws and regulations, and runs governmental programs. The bureaucracy and civil service carry out day-to-day governance. 

- **Rule adjudication**: The judiciary interprets and applies the law by resolving disputes and determining if rules are broken. It ensures that the rule-making and rule execution branches stay within their authority. An independent judiciary upholds the rule of law.

- **Communication with citizens**: Governments communicate with citizens to inform them of rules, policies, rights, and responsibilities. They also aim to get citizen inputs into the policymaking process through mechanisms like voting, public hearings, and petitions. An informed citizenry is essential for a thriving democracy.

The functions of government directly impact the lives of citizens. By studying how governments fulfill these core responsibilities, political science develops insights into the problems and prospects of societies. Understanding the role of government provides citizens the knowledge to participate effectively in civic life and shape public policies for the common good.

<exercise id="2" title="Indonesia Political Institutions, Political Party, And Interest Group">

## Introduction

Indonesia's complex political history has witnessed several pivotal periods that have shaped the nation's trajectory. From colonial rule to post-independence experiments with democracy, Indonesia's political landscape has evolved through various ideological influences, power struggles, and governance models. 

Tracing this rich historical tapestry offers insights into Indonesia's contemporary political dynamics. The interplay between colonial legacies, nationalism, political ideologies, institutional development, and cultural influences has molded Indonesia's political culture and structures.

Exploring the twists and turns of Indonesia's political journey reveals how certain epochs left indelible marks. The shifts between centralized and decentralized power, democratic aspirations and authoritarian control, and consensus-based and individual-centric leadership models underscore the fluid nature of Indonesian politics. 

While turbulent at times, Indonesia's political maturation reflects the difficulties of nation-building. As the world's largest archipelagic democracy continues to grow, the significance of past political watersheds becomes more evident. This examination of Indonesia's complex political history provides an interpretive framework to analyze the currents shaping its future.

## Colonial Era

The colonial era in Indonesia was marked by several key developments that impacted the nation's political and economic trajectory. One major feature was the introduction of social stratification by the Dutch colonial rulers. This involved categorizing indigenous Indonesians into social groups based on criteria such as occupation, income, and proximity to the colonial administration. 

At the top were the European settlers and colonial administrators. Below them was a small upper class of Indonesians who had roles in the civil service or private enterprises. The vast majority of Indonesians were in the lower social strata, providing manual labor in plantations, public works projects, and the informal economy. This stratification served to entrench colonial rule by elevating indigenous elites who supported Dutch interests.

Another defining aspect of the colonial era was the **Snouck Hurgronje system**, named after Dutch advisor Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje. Also known as the Ethical Policy, it involved the colonial administration recruiting indigenous civil servants exclusively from aristocratic families. This aimed to co-opt the indigenous elite by offering them privileged positions and benefits. Over time, this resulted in native bureaucratic and military corps developing parallel to the European apparatus. The Snouck system had long-term impacts by shaping an influential class of educated Indonesians who would play key roles in the independence movement. However, it also reinforced social divisions between elites and the general population.

<br>

## Post-Revolution

The post-revolution period in Indonesia experienced constitutional democracy, yet the parliamentary system proved challenging due to party fragmentation and frequent cabinet changes. After the revolution and independence from Dutch rule, Indonesia adopted a parliamentary system of government. Multiple political parties emerged, resulting in a fragmented party system with no single dominant party. This made it difficult to form stable coalition governments. 

Cabinets during this time period were short-lived, with frequent collapses and reshuffling of ministers. On average, a new cabinet was formed every nine months between 1950 to 1957. The high rate of cabinet turnover was partly due to personality conflicts between ministers from different parties. It also reflected unsettled conditions as the new nation grappled with economic troubles and regional rebellions. The post-revolution years saw a vibrant democratic process, but political instability hampered effective governance.

## Guided Democracy

The Guided Democracy era under President Sukarno saw notable deviations from constitutional norms, marked by strong presidential dominance and limited roles for political parties. 

During this period from 1959 to 1965, Sukarno exercised near-absolute control over the political system. The 1945 constitution was replaced with a new provisional constitution in 1959 that centralized executive power in the presidency and weakened parliamentary oversight. 

Sukarno also dissolved the elected parliament and replaced it with an appointed parliament. This allowed him to bypass parliamentary opposition and rule by decree. Political parties were forced to join together under one party, the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI), which further consolidated Sukarno's control.

The Guided Democracy years represented a shift away from Western-style parliamentary democracy toward what Sukarno termed "Guided Democracy." This was justified as a transitional phase suited to Indonesia's national character and level of political development at the time.

In practice, Guided Democracy meant strict limits on political freedoms and party competition. The role of parties was reduced to mobilizing mass support for government policies rather than formulating alternative platforms or ideologies. Parliament became a rubber stamp for Sukarno's policies.

Guided Democracy thus marked a period of unchallenged presidential dominance and the erosion of constitutional checks and balances. However, the system proved unstable and was unable to manage socioeconomic challenges, leading to Sukarno's eventual downfall. Nevertheless, it left a legacy of executive assertiveness that continued to influence Indonesian politics.

## The New Order Regime 

The New Order regime, under President Soeharto, emphasized Pancasila and constitutional democracy but with a strong executive. The regime consolidated power over time.

Some key aspects of the New Order period:

- Pancasila was promoted as the sole ideological foundation of all political parties and organizations. This emphasized national unity and rejected communism.
- The regime claimed to uphold the 1945 constitution and honor constitutional democracy. In practice, democracy was tightly managed and controlled.
- President Soeharto as head of state dominated the political system. The role of the People's Consultative Assembly declined. 
- The military (ABRI) held appointed seats in parliament and served a sociopolitical role alongside defense matters.
- Golkar, the regime's political vehicle, consistently won elections. Other parties were allowed but had limited room for maneuver. 
- Over time, the regime consolidated power by limiting dissent, controlling the press, restricting civil society, and gaining business interests. It created a stable environment for economic development.
- Regional rebellions in the late 1950s consolidated central authority. An anti-communist purge followed the alleged 1965 coup attempt. 
- The New Order brought over 30 years of authoritarian stability. But reforms were needed by the late 1990s due to social pressures, economic crisis, and political stagnation.

## Reformation Era

The Reformation era followed the New Order regime, aiming to correct the excesses of the past and emphasize democratic principles and parliamentary oversight. This period ushered in significant political reforms and a transition to democracy. 

Some key aspects of the Reformation era included:

- Constitutional reforms to limit presidential power and strengthen checks and balances. Amendments aimed to empower the House of Representatives (DPR).
- Decentralization reforms to give greater autonomy to local governments. This shifted power away from the central government.
- Electoral reforms such as direct presidential elections, allowing citizens to directly elect the president and vice president.
- The emergence of new political parties and a multi-party system. Restrictions on political parties were lifted.
- Greater press freedoms and reduced censorship. This allowed for more transparency and public discussion.
- A push to address human rights violations under the New Order regime. People demanded accountability for past abuses.
- East Timor's vote for independence in 1999, ending Indonesia's annexation. This shifted Indonesia's political boundaries. 
- A growth in political participation and activism. More citizens became involved in the political process.

Parliament took on a more assertive role during this era, exercising oversight and constraints on the presidency. Overall, Indonesia transitioned from an authoritarian regime to a democracy, albeit still imperfect and evolving. The Reformation era set the stage for Indonesia's contemporary political dynamics.

## Contemporary Politics

Transitioning into Indonesia's contemporary political landscape, the democracy movement remains a dynamic force, rooted more in societal dynamics rather than individual leadership. The mass movements that emerged in the late 1990s, calling for democratic reforms and the end of authoritarian rule, reflected a societal awakening and desire for change. This organic, grassroots energy served as the catalyst for Indonesia's transition to democracy. 

While past authoritarian leaders like Suharto often held tight control, today's democracy relies more on diffuse support within society. The contemporary democracy movement emerges through collaboration and coordination among various groups - students, labor unions, women's organizations, journalists, activists and more. Rather than a top-down structure, it operates through horizontal linkages within civil society.

The multifaceted nature of governmental functions is also evident in the diverse roles played by various institutions in Indonesia's contemporary politics. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches, along with the bureaucracy, each contribute unique elements to governance and oversight. The executive, consisting of the president, vice president and cabinet, oversees governmental administration and policymaking. The People's Representative Council (DPR), representing legislative functions, enacts laws and budgets. The Supreme Court and Constitutional Court fulfill judicial duties of upholding justice and interpreting the constitution. Meanwhile, the far-reaching bureaucracy implements policies and delivers public services across the nation. 

This interplay of institutions illustrates the complexity of orchestrating governmental responsibilities within a democratic system. It also highlights the diffusion and separation of powers, unlike the centralization of authority under past authoritarian regimes. Understanding these institutional dynamics provides deeper insight into Indonesia's evolving democratic landscape.

## Critical Political Issues

Indonesia faces several critical political issues that shape its contemporary landscape. Three major areas stand out: elections, the interplay of religion and politics, and challenges associated with decentralization.

**Elections**

Elections in the post-Suharto era have been meaningful in transitioning Indonesia to democracy. However, money politics has become entrenched, undermining the democratic process. Vote buying distorts policymaking as elected officials cater to wealthy backers over constituents. Strict enforcement of campaign finance laws is essential. Low voter turnout also threatens meaningful participation. Engaging voters through education and limiting practical barriers to voting like transportation access could boost turnout.  

**Religion and Politics**

The interaction between religion and politics holds profound influence in Indonesia. Islamist parties have gained traction, raising questions about Indonesia’s secular foundations. Hardline religious groups pressuring for Islamic law also threaten pluralism. However, most Indonesians reject formal Sharia implementation, preferring secular democracy. The challenge is balancing Indonesia’s Muslim identity while protecting minorities and upholding democratic principles.

**Decentralization**

Decentralizing power from Jakarta to local administrations aimed to improve governance and services. However, limited human resources and corruption at local levels have hindered progress. Central support through training and auditing local institutions could enhance outcomes. Effective decentralization requires capable local leaders focused on constituents, not personal gain. With strengthened local capacity, decentralization can help tailor policies to community needs across Indonesia’s diversity.

## Political Culture

Indonesia's political culture, shaped by the process of political socialization, exhibits diverse orientations. During the New Order era under President Suharto, hierarchical power structures and **patronage systems** characterized political culture. 

<center> <img src="modules\patronage.png" alt="Patronage" width="50%" /> </center>

<br>
<br>

Suharto's neo-patrimonialistic system focused power in the presidency rather than democratic institutions. This contributed to a subject political culture in which citizens largely complied with government dictates rather than actively participating. The government emphasized national ideology and unity over pluralism. 

Citizens were politically socialized to accept the dominant role of Golkar, the government party, as well as the military's dual function of security and sociopolitical affairs. Traditional patron-client ties between elites and followers were incorporated into the political system.

Overall, political culture under the New Order regime tended to emphasize order over freedom, consensus over dissent, and hierarchy over grassroots participation. The transition to democracy initiated efforts to change this culture by promoting active citizenship, power-sharing, and institutional accountability. However, legacy effects of previous authoritarian rule continue to shape political attitudes and behaviors.

## Political Dynasties

The intriguing phenomenon of political dynasties is present in Indonesia's political landscape, with the most notable being the Sukarno family. Their enduring influence stems from strong institutional foundations and effective political strategies that have enabled the dynasty to thrive across generations. 

The Sukarno family's dynasty began with Indonesia's first president, Sukarno, who laid critical groundwork during his presidency from 1945-1967. He allowed independent structures to develop that provided the foundations to sustain the dynasty beyond his leadership. This included the establishment of the Partai Nasional Indonesia (PNI) in 1927, which became a powerful political institution even after Sukarno's death.

The PNI gave the Sukarno family an established base of support that persisted as a dynasty-sustaining mechanism. Later presidents and leaders found it difficult to dismantle the PNI, demonstrating the dynasty's strength. Through this enduring party structure and identity, the Sukarno name maintained its potency in Indonesian politics.

While some observers have cited the absence of charismatic successors as a vulnerability for the Sukarno dynasty, the institutional structures built early on have compensated for this weakness. The family has relied on organizational mechanisms rather than sheer personality to perpetuate its influence across generations, making it a formidable dynasty within Indonesia's political arena.

## Legislative Institutions

Legislatures are representative bodies with vital governance functions. They are distinguished by key features including a multi-member composition and formal equality among members.

The primary function of legislatures is to legislate. This involves deliberating, debating, and voting on bills to enact laws. Legislatures serve as lawmaking bodies that create statutes to regulate society.

In addition to lawmaking, legislatures have several other crucial duties:

- **Appointing government officers** - Many high-ranking officials in the executive branch are nominated by the legislature. This includes cabinet members, judges, ambassadors, and leaders of agencies.
    
- **Judicial activities** - Legislative bodies often engage in judicial functions like impeachment trials and investigations into government misconduct.
    
- **Investigations** - Legislatures have oversight power to investigate operations and activities of the government through hearings, audits, and inquiries.
    
- **Ombudsmen role** - Legislators frequently act as representatives for citizens' interests and grievances related to the government. They serve an ombudsman role responding to public complaints.
    

By carrying out these diverse functions, legislative institutions form an indispensable pillar of governance and democracy. The legislative branch acts as a check on executive power and upholds the will of the people through elected representatives.

## Models of Legislative Structure

Transitioning to legislative structures, two prevalent models exist: the parliamentary system with a separate head of state and symbolic powers, and the presidential system where the chief executive holds dual roles as head of state and government.

In a parliamentary system, the head of state (monarch or president) possesses ceremonial powers but the head of government (prime minister) and cabinet conduct day-to-day governance and are drawn from the legislature. The executive is thus dependent upon legislative confidence.

In contrast, presidential systems fuse the roles of head of state and government in a president who serves as chief executive. The president appoints the cabinet but they are not members of the legislature. As the executive and legislative branches are independent, the president can't dissolve the legislature but faces the possibility of impeachment.

Parliamentary systems promote greater cooperation between the executive and legislative branches. The fusion of powers enables quicker decision-making during crises. However, the reliance on legislative confidence can create instability and weak, short-lived governments.

Presidential systems provide more separation of powers and checks and balances. But conflicts can arise between the executive and legislature over appointments, budgets, and policies. Deadlock becomes a possibility.

Overall, both systems have trade-offs in governance efficiency, representation, accountability, and power balances. The selection depends on a nation's context, culture, and specific needs.

## Representation Models in Legislatures

According to Marcus, there are three main representation models for legislators: delegate, trustee, and politico.

The delegate model of representation refers to when a legislator acts on the expressed wishes of constituents, regardless of the legislator's own opinion. In this model, the legislator serves as a conduit for the preferences of their district or state. They aim to reflect the views of their constituents rather than their own judgment.

In contrast, the trustee model of representation is when legislators use their own judgment when voting, acting in what they believe are their constituents' best interests, even if these actions contradict public opinion. Trustees are not bound by pledges to voters and feel no obligation to follow constituents' instructions. This model assumes that constituents have selected their representative for their wisdom and integrity.

Finally, the politico model combines elements of both the delegate and trustee models. Politicos typically promise to support the broad policy views of constituents but maintain independence to apply their discretion and expertise on individual issues. This flexible approach recognizes that legislators cannot be held to rigid standards on every issue and vote. The politico legislator balances responding to public opinion with acting on their own judgment.

## Executive Institutions

Executive institutions serve critical functions in governance. These include diplomacy, where the executive engages in relations with foreign governments and international bodies. Emergency leadership is another key function, with the executive mobilizing resources and personnel during crises.

Budget formulation is a central responsibility, as the executive drafts financial plans and submits them for legislative approval. Control of the military also falls under executive purview, encompassing deployment of armed forces and oversight of national security.

Administration is a major duty, with the executive establishing departments, agencies, and programs to implement policies. Policy initiation allows the executive to put forth legislative proposals and shape the political agenda.

Finally, executives fulfill symbolic leadership as head of state, acting as the ceremonial figurehead and representing the nation domestically and globally. Through these diverse functions, executive institutions wield substantial authority and influence in governance.

## Limits on Executive Power

While executive institutions often wield significant power, their authority is not absolute. Various mechanisms serve to impose checks and balances on the executive branch.

### Term Limits

One of the most direct ways to limit executive power is through term limits, which restrict the number of terms or years an individual can serve as head of government. This prevents an unchecked consolidation of power and forces routine turnover in leadership. Many presidential systems constitutionally limit presidents to two consecutive terms in office.

### External Sources of Power

Executive power can also face limitations imposed by external actors and sources of authority. These may include the military in some regimes, powerful economic actors, influential social/religious institutions, or even public opinion and media scrutiny. Though not formal limitations, these factors shape and constrict executive decision-making.

### Institutional Constraints

Finally, constraints by other government institutions represent a significant check on executive authority. The legislative and judicial branches can block or overturn executive actions through legislation and review. An independent legislature can force negotiation and accountability. Empowered courts can deem executive policies unconstitutional. And quasi-independent agencies created by law can also curb executive power in their realms. The separation of powers baked into many government structures purposefully establishes these institutional constraints.

## Judicial Institutions

Judicial institutions, commonly referred to as courts or judicial systems, serve crucial governance functions including conflict resolution, social control, protection of minority rights, and policymaking.

Courts aim to resolve disputes through application of relevant principles. Key justice principles that guide judicial systems include:

- Procedural fairness - fair and transparent procedures
- Substantive fairness - fair and reasonable outcomes
- Accessibility - ease of access to justice
- Efficiency - timely and effective dispute resolution
- Independence and impartiality - unbiased decision making

Two predominant legal systems are the **adversarial system**, where opposing parties present their cases and judges act as referees, and the **inquisitorial system** where judges take an investigative role.

<center> <img src="modules\the principle of justice.png" alt="system of justice" width="50%" /> </center>
<br>
<br>

Various types of law guide judicial institutions. These include:

- Natural law - universal principles derived from nature or divinity
- Positive law - established rules enacted by government
- Statutory law - written laws passed by legislative bodies
- Common law - law established by judicial precedent
- Civil law - governs relations between individuals
- Criminal law - classifies crimes and specifies punishments

Judicial institutions apply these laws and principles to fulfill their societal roles. The form and function of courts varies across political systems and jurisdictions.

## Bureaucratic Institutions

Bureaucratic institutions form a crucial part of any governance structure, staffed by qualified officials who are responsible for policy implementation. Their primary purpose is to carry out the work of government that requires specialized expertise, within a hierarchical organizational structure designed to promote efficiency and accountability.

The bureaucracy is meant to operate based on a meritocratic system, recruiting and promoting officials based on their qualifications rather than political connections. Officials are expected to faithfully execute policies regardless of changing political leadership. They typically enjoy security of tenure to protect them from politicization.

Some key features of effective bureaucratic institutions include:

- Specialization and division of labor - Officials focus on distinct areas like finance, health, defense based on educational background and experience.
- Hierarchy and clear reporting structures - Lower level officials report to higher officials with decision making authority.
- Written rules, procedures and records - Standardized processes guide actions and preserve institutional memory.
- Merit-based recruitment and promotion - Appointments and advancement are based on skills and performance, not patronage.
- Tenure protections - Officials have job protections against politically motivated firing.
- Neutral competence - Actions are objective and non-partisan in nature.

By leveraging trained experts operating under well-defined rules and procedures, bureaucratic institutions aim to implement policies and deliver public services effectively and consistently. A capable, professionalized bureaucracy can provide stability and continuity for governance. However, bureaucracies can also become overly rigid and unresponsive. Finding the right balance is an ongoing challenge.

## Legislative History of Indonesia

Indonesia's legislative history can be divided into 15 periods from 1918 to 2004:

### Volksraad (1918-1942)

This was the first legislative body in Indonesia established by the Dutch colonial government. It served in an advisory capacity to the Governor-General.

### Badan Penyelidik Usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan (BPUPK) (1945)

BPUPK was formed to prepare for Indonesian independence. It produced the draft constitution that became the basis for Indonesia’s 1945 constitution.

### Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP) (1945-1949)

KNIP functioned as a temporary legislative body after independence was declared in 1945. It appointed Sukarno as president and Hatta as vice president.

### United States of Indonesia (RIS) (1949-1950)

The RIS legislature known as the Constitutional Assembly of the United States of Indonesia served during the short-lived federal state period.

### Parliament of the Republic of Indonesia (1950-1959)

After the RIS dissolved, the unitary Republic of Indonesia was formed with its own parliament. This is sometimes referred to as the era of liberal democracy in Indonesia.

### Gotong Royong Parliament (1960-1965)

After Sukarno dissolved the 1950 parliament and declared guided democracy, the Gotong Royong Parliament was formed and dominated by appointees.

### Temporary People's Consultative Assembly (MPRS) (1965-1968)

After Sukarno's fall, General Suharto led a new order government. The MPRS served as the legislature during the transition.

### People's Representative Council (DPR) (1968-1999)

The New Order government under Suharto established the DPR as the lower house within a limited legislative system.

### Reformasi & Amendment of 1945 Constitution (1999-2004)

After Suharto's resignation, amendments were made to the 1945 constitution, including provisions related to the DPR.

### Post-2004

From 1999 onwards, the DPR has been directly elected by the people every 5 years, starting in 2004. This represents Indonesia's Reformasi era legislative body.

## Executive Institutions in Indonesia

Moving to the executive structure in Indonesia, the 1945 Constitution established a presidential system with a president serving as both head of state and head of government. This structure was in place from 1945 to 1959.

The president was directly elected and could serve a maximum of two five-year terms. They had the power to appoint and dismiss cabinet ministers. The president was also the supreme commander of the armed forces.

In 1959, Indonesia moved briefly to a parliamentary system, but presidentialism was restored in 1965. From 1967 to 1998 during the "New Order" period under President Suharto's authoritarian rule, the president held strong executive powers.

After the fall of Suharto in 1998, Indonesia's post-reformation era saw the presidency retain its dominant position but with some limitations to presidential powers. Direct presidential elections were reintroduced in 2004.

The president and vice president are directly elected as a ticket and can serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms. The president heads the cabinet and has broad appointment powers over top military and government positions. However, the president's ability to dismiss the legislature is limited, and presidential emergency powers are subject to parliamentary oversight.

Overall, Indonesia's presidential system concentrates executive authority in the presidency, while incorporating some checks and balances. From the initial structure in 1945 to the present, the core role of the president as dual head of state and government has persisted.

## Judicial Institutions in Indonesia

### Post-Reformation Entities and Roles

The judicial system in Indonesia underwent significant reforms following the end of the New Order regime in 1998. Some of the key judicial institutions established in the post-reformation era include:

- **Mahkamah Konstitusi (Constitutional Court)** - Formed in 2003, the Constitutional Court rules on disputes over the constitutionality of laws and hear disputes on election results and the dissolution of political parties. It has the authority to review and strike down laws that are deemed unconstitutional.
- **Mahkamah Agung (Supreme Court)** - As the highest court in the judicial system, the Supreme Court hears appeals from lower courts. It also has the authority to review regional regulations and has jurisdiction over military courts.
- **Komisi Yudisial (Judicial Commission)** - Established in 2004, the Judicial Commission nominates candidates for appointment as Supreme Court justices. It also has the authority to maintain ethics and discipline in the courts.
- **Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi (Corruption Eradication Commission)** - Formed in 2003, the KPK investigates and prosecutes major cases of corruption. It has broader authority than the Attorney General's office to wiretap and make arrests.
- **Komisi Nasional Anti Kekerasan terhadap Perempuan (National Commission on Violence Against Women)** - Established in 1998, this commission develops policies, monitors cases, and provides services related to violence against women.
- **Komisi Ombudsman Nasional (National Ombudsman Commission)** - Formed in 2000, the Ombudsman Commission oversees public services and investigates maladministration in the public sector. It has the authority to investigate complaints and issue recommendations.

These post-reformation judicial institutions have played important oversight, anti-corruption and public advocacy roles in the years since democratic reforms began in Indonesia.

<exercise id="3" title="The Evolution of Indonesia's Political Party System">

## Introduction

Ruling political parties are pivotal actors within political systems, whether in totalitarian regimes, authoritarian governments, or democratic systems. These parties play an outsized role in mobilizing and controlling mass participation, often operating under significant governmental oversight and control. Even in authoritarian contexts, ruling parties actively promote mass public support for the government in power. 

Political parties, as distinct from interest groups, serve as organized entities that aim to elect their candidates to government offices, thereby directly influencing policies. In democratic systems, parties compete against each other in elections to gain power, and voters use party identification as a heuristic to choose between candidates. This dynamic clearly illustrates the integral role political parties play in shaping the political landscape.

Beyond electoral competition, the functions of political parties also encompass recruiting political leaders, formulating government policies and programs, and organizing government structures. These diverse functions all contribute to the overarching influence and impact political parties exert on governance structures and outcomes.

## Definition and Function of Political Parties

Political parties, distinct from interest groups, serve as organized entities aiming to place their representatives in government offices, thereby influencing policies. In democratic systems, parties compete to elect leaders, and voters utilize party labels to identify candidates. This dynamic showcases the integral role political parties play in shaping the political landscape.

The functions of political parties extend beyond electoral competition. They involve the recruitment of political leaders, the formulation of government policies and programs, and the organization of government structures. These functions collectively contribute to the overall influence and impact of political parties on governance.

In contrast, interest groups focus solely on influencing government public policy in specific areas. Unlike political parties, interest groups do not seek to elect leaders to government offices but concentrate on advocating for policies aligned with their goals.

The key distinction is that political parties aim to gain control of government through elections to enact broad policies, while interest groups focus narrowly on their issue area and seek to influence policy through advocacy and lobbying. This delineation highlights the broader governance role of political parties.

## Categorization of Party Systems 

Political scientist Jean Blondel developed an influential categorization of party systems that highlights the diversity of structures under which political parties operate globally. Blondel identified four main types of party systems:

**Non-Partisan Systems**

In certain political systems, political parties are absent entirely. Government administration operates without distinct political parties mobilizing electoral participation. Historical examples include Libya under Gaddafi and Uganda under Amin.  

**One-Party Systems** 

This model involves single party rule, with one dominant political party controlling the government. Opposition parties are either officially outlawed or unable to effectively challenge the ruling party's power. Examples include China under the Communist Party, Mexico under PRI dominance, and South Korea under Liberal Party rule in the 1950s-60s.

**Two-Party Systems**

A two-party system involves two major political parties that alternate power over an extended period. The United States is a prominent example, with Democrats and Republicans dominating national politics. Other examples include Malta and Jamaica.

**Multi-Party Systems** 

In a system with multiple significant political parties, power alternates between different coalitions of parties over time. India and Netherlands showcase diverse multi-party systems. No single party is able to achieve an outright majority, necessitating coalition governments.

Blondel's categorization illuminates the contrast between systems where a single political party monopolizes power versus competitive multi-party democracies. It underscores the pivotal role parties play in structuring governance.

## Evolution of Indonesia's Party System

Indonesia's political party system has undergone major transformations through different political eras. 

In the early parliamentary democracy after independence, Indonesia saw a proliferation of political parties, with over 30 parties competing in the 1955 elections. This was partly fueled by tensions between Islamists and nationalists, as well as ideological divisions within these camps. Several Islamic parties emerged, while nationalist parties like the Indonesian National Party (PNI) and the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) vied for power. 

This parliamentary system was fraught with instability, leading to Sukarno declaring guided democracy in 1957. Under Sukarno's authoritarian leadership, the political system consolidated into three factions - nationalism, religion, and communism. The Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI) represented nationalism, two Islamic parties Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Masyumi spoke for religion, while the PKI championed communism. This marked a shift from the earlier proliferation of parties to a simpler tripartite system.

The rise to power of Suharto in 1967 saw him banning most political parties and instituting a restrictive authoritarian regime for over 30 years. Only two parties were allowed during this period - Suharto's own Golongan Karya (Golkar) party and the PPP, an amalgamation of several Islamic parties. The regime used Golkar to exert control and monopolize power, reducing the role of political parties. 

However, Suharto's fall in 1998 led to democratization and political liberalization. This opened the floodgates for new political parties to emerge in Indonesia. From just 3 parties in 2004, the number rapidly rose to 24 parties contesting the 2019 elections. This shift marked a new chapter in Indonesia's political landscape.

## Proliferation of Parties in Early Parliamentary Era

Indonesia's early parliamentary democracy era in the 1950s saw a proliferation of political parties, with over 30 parties forming during this period. This fragmented landscape was characterized by regionalism, with parties organized around ethnic, religious and local interests competing for power and influence. 

The initial euphoria after independence led to idealistic goals of fulfilling regional aspirations through political vehicles. This resulted in a surge of parties representing distinct ethnic groups, religious denominations, islands, and provinces. The four largest parties were secular nationalist parties with ties to the independence movement, but they failed to establish nationwide dominance.

Smaller, regionally-based parties had strongholds in certain areas but little national presence. This fragmentation and regionalism ultimately bred dissatisfaction with the ineffective parliamentary system. The proliferation of localized parties catering to specific constituencies made it difficult to form stable ruling coalitions or achieve coherent national policymaking.

## Sukarno's Guided Democracy

Sukarno's rise to power in the late 1950s marked a shift towards guided democracy and growing nationalism in Indonesia. Faced with ethnic and regional tensions, Sukarno sought to exert greater control over the political structures. 

A key characteristic of this period was the increasing authority exerted by Sukarno over the parliamentary system and political parties. The 1945 constitution had established a parliamentary democracy, but Sukarno aimed to consolidate power in the presidency. 

In 1957, Sukarno declared martial law and introduced Guided Democracy - an authoritarian system with Sukarno at the helm. Political parties were forced to amalgamate into two groups, reducing opposition and dissent. The Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI), with its emphasis on nationalism aligned with Sukarno's vision, became the dominant political force during this period.

The Guided Democracy era saw Sukarno consolidate authority and suppress regionalism and ethnic-based parties. By controlling the political party system, Sukarno was able to centralize power and promote a nationalist ideology. However, this growing authoritarianism sowed the seeds for future political turmoil.

## Suharto's Authoritarian Rule

Suharto rose to power in 1967 following an attempted communist coup. His authoritarian New Order regime was marked by the dominance of Golkar, the ruling political party tied to the military. Under Suharto, restrictions were imposed on political participation and activity. 

Golkar served as the main government-backed party, essentially functioning as the only party allowed to participate in elections during Suharto's rule. Opposition parties were limited through measures like requiring Pancasila to be recognized as their sole ideology. This allowed Golkar to emerge victorious with landslide majorities in rigged elections.

The political system under Suharto was designed to restrict any challenges to his authoritarian rule. Opposition parties and voices were suppressed. Strict control was enforced over the media and civil society. An electoral system based on proportional representation with appointed regional representatives guaranteed Golkar's dominance in parliament. This enabled Suharto to consolidate power and govern in an authoritarian manner for over 30 years.

## Post-Suharto Liberalization

The fall of Suharto's authoritarian New Order regime in 1998 marked a major turning point for Indonesia's political landscape. Political reforms instituted after Suharto's resignation led to significant changes in the country's party system.

One of the most notable changes was the elimination of restrictions on establishing new political parties. Under the New Order, the government had placed severe limitations on forming new parties outside of the existing three sanctioned ones - Golkar, PDI, and PPP. However, the post-Suharto reforms removed these barriers, leading to a proliferation of new parties entering the scene.

Within just a few years after Suharto stepped down, the number of parties contesting national elections swelled from three to over 100. This was a dramatic shift from the rigid party system that had existed for over three decades under the New Order regime. A wider range of political voices and ideologies found expression through these newly formed parties.

Some of the more influential parties emerging in the immediate post-Suharto period included the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), led by Suharto's successor Megawati Sukarnoputri, and the National Awakening Party (PKB), with support bases among Muslim constituencies. The National Mandate Party (PAN) and the Justice and Unity Party (PKP) also drew significant support in early elections.

This proliferation of new parties marked a clear departure from the dominance of Golkar, PDI, and PPP under Suharto's New Order. It signaled greater political liberalization and a more open, democratic process taking root in the post-authoritarian era. The influx of parties represented the voices of Reformasi, reflecting the public's demand for transparent, representative politics after decades of restrictive government control over the party system.

## Key Takeaways

The evolution of Indonesia's political party system highlights the pivotal role of ruling parties in shaping a country's political landscape. In the early parliamentary democracy era, Indonesia had over 30 political parties competing for power and influence. This led to regionalism and ethnic conflict as parties mobilized support along those lines. 

Sukarno's guided democracy saw the rise of certain parties aligned with his governance approach, exerting control over political participation. Subsequently, Suharto's authoritarian New Order regime restricted the party system to just three parties, enabling the dominance of Golkar. This single party acted as the main ruling party supporting Suharto's regime.

The fall of Suharto gave rise to dramatic reforms, including the influx of new political parties no longer bound by past restrictions. This shift marked a new multiparty era in Indonesia's history. Overall, the trajectory illustrates how ruling parties in power can significantly impact a country's political development, often used to exert control by authoritarian regimes.

## Conclusion

Political party systems play an integral role in governance and the functioning of diverse political structures globally. While parties serve as organized entities competing for power, the prevalence of dominant ruling parties underpins many political systems regardless of regime type. 

Authoritarian governments and totalitarian regimes often utilize ruling parties to mobilize and control mass participation. But even in these constrained environments, dominant ruling parties actively promote mass support for their authoritarian governments. 

Across political systems, the importance of political parties stems from their multifaceted functions beyond just electoral competition. Their role extends to recruiting leaders, formulating policies, and organizing government structures. Through these functions, ruling parties in particular hold tremendous influence over governance and policymaking.

Understanding the categorization of party systems provides perspective on the varied structures that political parties operate within. While some nations lack organized party systems entirely, others feature single-party dominance or multiparty competition. Appreciating this diversity helps underscore the pivotal role played by political parties and ruling parties worldwide.

<exercise id="4" title="Civil-Military Relations in Indonesia">

## Introduction 

Indonesia's military has played a central role in the country's politics and governance throughout its history, from independence in 1945 to the present day. During the authoritarian "New Order" era under President Suharto from 1965 to 1998, the military was a key pillar supporting his regime, with both political and economic power. However, since the collapse of the New Order and Indonesia's transition to democracy, the role and position of the military has evolved significantly. Democratization has required the military to withdraw from day-to-day politics and governance and focus on national defense and security matters. At the same time, the military has retained significant influence, presenting ongoing challenges in civil-military relations in the country. Key issues include the military's distrust of political Islam, its vast economic interests developed under the New Order, and debates over its proper role in a democratic Indonesia. This content examines the major historical shifts and current tensions in civil-military relations in the post-Suharto democratic era. Understanding this complex dynamic between military, political and civilian actors is crucial to analyzing Indonesia's democratization progress and future policy directions.

## Dwifungsi Doctrine Under Sukarno and Suharto

The dwifungsi ("dual function") doctrine refers to the Indonesian military's formalized role in politics and security matters. The origins of dwifungsi trace back to General Abdul Haris Nasution during the era of President Sukarno in the 1950s and 1960s. 

Nasution introduced the military's perspective of being the guardian of national unity and order, which later became known as the "middle path." The doctrine justified military involvement in government by positioning the armed forces as protectors of the Indonesian revolution.

Later, under President Suharto's New Order regime beginning in the 1960s, dwifungsi became further entrenched. The military secured appointed positions across all levels of legislature. This institutionalized the military's function as both a security force and sociopolitical actor. The New Order provided the doctrinal basis for the military's central role in governance and politics leading up to 1998.

## Military's Central Role Pre-1998

The Indonesian military held a central role in Indonesia prior to 1998, with a strong focus on its position as the guardian of national unity. This perspective was rooted in the military's foundational role in the Indonesian revolution and independence struggle against Dutch colonial rule. 

After independence in 1945, the military saw itself as the protector of the new nation. This was formalized through the doctrine of dwifungsi, which emphasized the military's dual role as both a defense force and a socio-political force. The military sought to defend the unitary state of Indonesia against separatist movements and ideological threats from communism or political Islam.

Under President Sukarno in the 1950s and 1960s, the military grew in prominence as Sukarno relied heavily on the loyalty of the armed forces. The military leadership at the time, led by General Nasution, believed that the army must play an active role in politics and governance to defend national interests. 

This political role was further entrenched under President Suharto's New Order regime from 1965-1998. The military was seen as the backbone of the regime and the guardian of stability, unity, and order. Suharto relied on the military to suppress dissent, while military officers were appointed to key political and economic positions. The military's socio-political function was seen as essential to managing Indonesia's diversity and fragility.

## Post-1998 Reforms and New Leaders

The fall of Suharto in 1998 marked a major shift in Indonesia's civil-military relations. As the country transitioned towards democracy, the military began ceding some of its political power. However, the military remained a dominant force during this fragile period.

Under President BJ Habibie, who took over after Suharto resigned, the military maintained substantial influence. Habibie had served as Suharto's vice president and was viewed as an extension of the old regime. The military ensured their interests were protected during Habibie's short term.

Greater change came under President Abdurrahman Wahid, who was elected by the People's Consultative Assembly in 1999. Wahid aimed to establish civilian supremacy over the military, which caused tensions. He made efforts to remove the military's formal representation in the legislature and pushed officers implicated in human rights abuses during the Suharto era to retire. 

Wahid also wanted to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, which the TNI opposed. Despite resistance, Wahid's presidency marked the beginning of reforms limiting the military's formal political power. But the TNI remained influential, especially due to its vast economic interests.

## Persisting Challenges

Even as Indonesia's military took on a less dominant role after 1998, challenges persist in civil-military relations. One major issue stems from the military's distrust of political Islam. The Indonesian armed forces have been dominated by secular nationalists in the leadership ranks since independence. This created skepticism within the military establishment towards Muslim political movements, which were seen as a potential threat to national unity and stability. 

The military's historical role in suppressing Muslim rebellions in the 1950s and 1960s exacerbated this distrust towards political Islam. Campaigns against Darul Islam and other uprisings left the armed forces wary of Muslim political mobilization. As a result, the secular nationalism prevalent in the military creates tensions with Islamist parties and hinders fully harmonious civil-military relations. Even though the military no longer asserts direct political control, its unease with political Islam lingers and poses an obstacle to smooth relations between military leadership and emerging democratic institutions.

## Military's Economic Interests

The New Order era under President Suharto saw the development of military-run businesses across various sectors of the economy. This allowed the military to amass significant economic interests and financial resources outside of its defense activities. 

Some of the key businesses that the military became involved in included:

- **Natural resource extraction** - The military moved into controlling various mining and plantations interests across the archipelago. This provided lucrative revenue streams from the country's vast natural resources in timber, palm oil, coal, nickel and other minerals. 

- **Finance** - Military-linked banks and financial institutions were established, providing financing services to military businesses and personnel. Key banks have included Bank Artha Graha and Bank Bumi Daya.

- **Real estate** - The military expanded into commercial and residential real estate development in urban centers across Java, Bali and other parts of Indonesia. Luxury housing projects and shopping centers became part of the military's business portfolio.

- **Construction** - Military engineering and construction groups undertook large-scale infrastructure projects, including toll roads, ports and airports. These capital-intensive projects relied on the military's project mobilization capabilities.

This vast economic involvement provided significant off-budget revenue for the military's interests. It also strengthened the military's influence across political and business circles in Indonesia during this era. However, it posed challenges for establishing proper oversight and balance in civil-military relations after 1998.

## Megawati Administration

The administration of President Megawati Sukarnoputri from 2001 to 2004 marked a period of more harmonious civil-military relations in Indonesia. As the daughter of Indonesia's founding father Sukarno, Megawati brought an air of stability and national unity during a time of democratic transition. 

Upon becoming president, Megawati exercised civilian control over the military by selecting loyalists for key military leadership positions. This included General Sutarto as the commander of the armed forces. At the same time, Megawati did not aggressively pursue investigations into past military human rights abuses, which helped avoid confrontations.

Megawati also reduced the formal political role of the military. She dissolved the military faction in parliament and separated the police force from the military. These reforms shifted the military's focus towards external defense while ending its domestic security role.

Additionally, Megawati empowered reformist officers and marginalized hardliners. This helped professionalize the armed forces and align them with democratic principles. The military supported Megawati's presidency, seeing her as a source of stability amidst Indonesia's fragile democracy.

In turn, Megawati recognized the military's important role in national unity and nation-building. She treated the military with respect while asserting civilian control. This balance created a more constructive partnership between civilian leaders and the armed forces.

Overall, Megawati's pragmatic approach produced a period of cooperative civil-military relations. Her presidency marked a shift away from the military's dominant political position during the New Order era. Though challenges remained, Megawati helped normalize democratic oversight of the military.

## Quelling Muslim Rebellions 

One source of the Indonesian military's distrust of political Islam stems from its historical role in suppressing Muslim rebellions during the 1950s and 1960s. The most significant of these was the Darul Islam rebellion, which emerged in West Java in the 1940s under the leadership of S.M. Kartosuwirjo. Darul Islam sought to establish Indonesia as an Islamic state under sharia law.

The movement grew in strength during the 1950s as the central government was embroiled in regional rebellions across the archipelago. By 1962, Darul Islam had around 15,000 armed guerillas and controlled territories in West Java, South Sulawesi, Aceh, and South Kalimantan. The Indonesian military finally quashed the main Darul Islam rebellion in West Java in 1962 after a 12-year campaign. However, splinter Darul Islam movements continued in remote areas until the early 1970s. 

Suppressing the Darul Islam rebellion required tremendous effort from the Indonesian army over more than a decade. Thousands of troops were involved in encircling and rooting out rebel enclaves. This campaign left an enduring mark on the military leadership, ingraining both disdain for radical political Islam as well as confidence in the army's ability to defeat such movements. The suppression of Darul Islam cemented the military's self-perception as defenders of Indonesia's secular nationalist ideology against what they saw as extremist elements. This outlook continues to shape the military's distrustful stance towards political Islam today.

## Democratic Reforms

The post-Suharto era saw major reforms aimed at decentralizing power and increasing accountability within the military and political system. Some key democratic reforms included:

- Decentralization of governmental powers to provinces and districts through laws enacted in 1999 and 2004. This shifted significant authority away from Jakarta towards local governments.

- Changes in civil-military relations, including the separation of the police force from the military in 1999. The police formally came under the jurisdiction of the president rather than the military.

- The establishment of the TNI Territorial Command Structure, dividing the army's territorial organization along provincial and district borders to align with the decentralized system. This aimed to increase accountability.

- The gradual removal of appointed military representatives from political bodies at national, provincial and district levels during reforms from 1999-2004. 

- Requiring all active TNI personnel to retire from military service before running for or taking up civilian political posts. This addressed previous issues of "dual function" roles.

- Establishing human rights courts and ad hoc human rights tribunals to investigate allegations of human rights violations by the military.

- Generally increasing civilian oversight, auditing and scrutiny of the military's finances and businesses. This helped reduce corruption and illegal practices.

The democratic reforms ultimately sought to embed accountability mechanisms, increase transparency, decentralize power from Jakarta, and reduce the military's direct role in governmental affairs. The process of reform has been gradual but impactful.

## Conclusion

Indonesia's civil-military relations have undergone significant changes from the central role of the military under past authoritarian leaders to a more balanced relationship in the post-Suharto democratic era. 

The military doctrine of dwifungsi established the military as a sociopolitical force beyond just national defense, allowing the armed forces to have an outsized influence on politics and the economy under Sukarno and Suharto's long tenures. Following Suharto's fall in 1998, Indonesia embarked on a fragile transition to democracy, accompanied by reforms that reduced the military's formal role in politics and governance.

However, challenges remain due to the military's vast economic interests, suspicion of political Islam, and lingering authoritarian tendencies. The military continues to wield influence informally through its network of businesses and retired officers in civilian roles. Issues like accountability for past human rights abuses also remain unresolved. 

The post-authoritarian period has seen gradual improvements in civil-military balance under leaders like Megawati, though more progress is needed to consolidate democratic norms. As Indonesia evolves politically, managing the military's role in an increasingly pluralistic landscape will be an ongoing task requiring deft leadership and negotiation. Ultimately, a constructive civil-military dynamic that respects democratic values will be key to Indonesia's future as a mature democracy.

<exercise id="5" title="Indonesia's Electoral Landscape">

## Introduction

Indonesia is the world's third largest democracy, with a population of over 260 million people across over 17,000 islands. Since the end of authoritarian rule in 1998, the country has held regular democratic elections, making it a regional model for democratic consolidation. General elections serve as a barometer of the health and maturity of Indonesia's democracy. They provide opportunities for citizens to choose their representatives and hold them accountable. 

Elections also compel parties and politicians to organize and communicate their platforms to the public. Successive elections have seen high voter turnout and participation across the archipelago. This highlights the population's embrace of electoral democracy and peaceful transfer of power. However, past elections have also exposed deep political and societal divides based on ethnicity, religion and class. Managing free and fair elections across thousands of islands and hundreds of ethnic groups remains an ongoing challenge. As the world's largest Muslim democracy, Indonesia's elections are also closely watched by the global community as a harbinger for Islam's compatibility with democracy.

## Definition of General Elections 

In many democratic nations, general elections serve as important symbols and measures of the health of a country's democracy. Elections represent the public's participation in choosing political leadership and provide a ritualized opportunity for people to make their voices heard.

However, elections alone do not fully encompass the meaning of democracy. True democracy requires ongoing public participation beyond just voting in periodic elections. Activities like joining political parties, organizing around issues, lobbying representatives, and participating in civil society help ensure that the public has influence in between elections as well. 

While elections provide a snapshot of the public's preferences, ongoing civic participation helps translate those preferences into substantive policy changes on an everyday basis. Therefore, general elections symbolize and measure democracy, but need to be complemented by sustained public engagement in the political process for a democracy to truly thrive.

## Electoral Systems

There are two major principles determining structure general election systems use - the single member constituency system and the multi member constituency system. 

### Single Member Constituencies

The single member constituency system, also known as the district system, has each elected representative tied to a specific geographic constituency. This fosters greater accountability as the representative must closely align with constituent interests to be re-elected. It also promotes party integration and cooperation as representatives must work within their party to attain parliamentary majorities. However, a key disadvantage is that it can lead to distortions between the percentage of votes a party receives and the number of representatives it has in parliament. Smaller parties may get left out entirely.

### Multi Member Constituencies  

In contrast, the multi member proportional representation system aims to closely match the percentage of votes a party receives with the percentage of seats it gets in parliament. This makes it more representative of voter preferences. However, it tends to accentuate party differences over constituency concerns, as representatives feel accountable to the party first. This can contribute to political fragmentation as many smaller parties can gain seats. It also weakens the direct relationship between constituents and their representatives.

## Single Member Constituencies (District System)

The single-member constituency system, also known as the district system, is one of the two fundamental principles for structuring general elections. Under this system, electoral districts are delineated with each district represented by a single elected official. 

This system promotes greater party integration and cooperation as candidates often require endorsement from their party to win their district's election. Smaller and new parties may find it more difficult to gain traction and win seats under this structure, limiting the formation of new parties in the political system.

In addition, the single-member district system fosters a closer tie between the elected representative and their constituents in that district. This can simplify the process of attaining parliamentary majorities. However, one disadvantage is that it can potentially lead to distortions between the percentage of votes a party receives across districts and the number of seats they hold in the legislature. A party could win a large share of votes but only a small number of seats if their support is dispersed across many districts at modest levels.

Overall, the single-member constituency system emphasizes party integration and alliances while constraining new party growth. It links representatives firmly to geographic districts though vote percentages may not align cleanly with legislative seats.

## Multi Member Constituencies 

Conversely, the proportional representation system that uses multi-member constituencies is deemed more representative, as it better aligns the percentage of votes a party receives with the percentage of parliamentary seats they are allocated. This helps ensure that the number of seats each party gets closely reflects their portion of the national vote.

However, proportional representation systems that use multi-member constituencies also tend to accentuate differences between parties, as they encourage many different parties to run rather than forcing them to form pre-electoral coalitions. This can lead to a more fragmented political landscape with many small parties representing narrow interests rather than a few large "big tent" parties.  

In addition, representatives elected in multi-member proportional systems tend to prioritize their party's interests over the concerns of their geographic constituencies. Since they are elected based on their party's share of the vote rather than a specific district's support, they are incentivized to follow the party line rather than be accountable and responsive to a defined group of constituents.

## Indonesia's Electoral History

Indonesia held its first general election in 1955 after gaining independence in 1949. This inaugural election utilized a proportional representation system that integrated elements of district and party-list models. Voters could cast ballots for individual candidates in electoral districts as well as political parties. 

Over the following decades, Indonesia's electoral system underwent various reforms that altered the blend between district and proportional mechanisms. In the 1970s, closed party lists were introduced, reducing the voters' ability to select individual candidates. This decade also saw an increase in the number of electoral districts.

Additional reforms came in the early 2000s after the fall of Suharto's authoritarian New Order regime in 1998. In 2004, Indonesia adopted a mixed electoral framework that incorporated both district and proportional systems. For the People's Representative Council (DPR), the proportional open-list model was maintained. However, the new Regional Representative Council (DPD) utilized a single-member district system.

This hybrid model reflected an effort to balance the district system's tendency to promote party integration and the proportional system's representativeness of diverse viewpoints. Indonesia's electoral evolution displays a nuanced navigation of the tradeoffs inherent in each system.

## 2004 Reforms

In 2004, Indonesia implemented reforms to its electoral system. A district system was introduced for the Regional Representative Council (DPD), while proportional representation was maintained for other legislative bodies like the People's Representative Council (DPR).

Under the district system, DPD representatives are elected from constituencies at the provincial level. This ties them more closely to their constituents in the regions. The number of DPD members per province depends on its population. 

The rationale was to provide better regional representation. DPD members are focused on voicing regional interests at the national level. The district system was seen as simplifying the process for voters to elect representatives devoted to their province.

At the same time, proportional representation was kept for the DPR and other bodies. This maintained a close alignment between the percentage of votes obtained by political parties and their number of seats in the legislature. The proportional system was deemed important to reflect the will of voters across Indonesia.

By blending district and proportional elements, the 2004 reforms aimed to balance improved regional representation with fair reflection of national voter preferences. This dual approach was viewed as suiting Indonesia's diverse population spread across many islands and provinces.

## Conclusion 

As evidenced by Indonesia's electoral history, designing an election system requires careful consideration of context. The nation's initial 1955 system with proportional representation sought broad representation amidst a diverse population. However, subsequent shifts introduced localized single member constituencies to promote party cohesion while retaining proportional mechanisms to reflect voter preferences. The 2004 reforms blend both district and proportional systems through localized DPD representatives and party-list parliamentary members. 

Overall, Indonesia's experience highlights the importance of balancing representation and stability based on a country's socio-political realities. There are merits to both single member plurality and proportional systems - the former fosters accountability and cohesive parties while the latter ensures diverse representation. Electoral systems inevitably involve trade-offs and revisions to address evolving needs. Indonesia provides an insightful example of these dynamics, with context determining the appropriate electoral framework.

While no system is perfect, Indonesia's efforts illustrate an electoral evolution seeking representativeness within a fragmented society and stability amidst decentralized governance. As the nation moves forward, harnessing the benefits of both plurality and proportional mechanisms can strengthen its democracy. Most importantly, elections should not be seen as an endpoint, but as part of broader participatory processes enabling citizen voice and oversight between polls.

<exercise id="6" title="Democracy In Indonesia - Decentralization">

## Introduction

Indonesia has undergone significant political transformations throughout its history, from colonial rule under the Dutch to dictatorship under Suharto to the current democratic era. A key component of Indonesia's post-Suharto political reforms has been decentralization, the transfer of authority and responsibility from the central government to local governmental entities. 

Decentralization was implemented in Indonesia in 1999 in response to calls for regional autonomy and more equitable development. It also aimed to address secessionist pressures and defuse tensions resulting from the Java-centric policies of previous regimes. By devolving powers to the district and municipal levels, decentralization sought to bring government closer to the people and allow more direct political participation.

This reform marked a major shift in Indonesia's highly centralized governance system inherited from both colonial rule and Suharto's authoritarian New Order regime. Over the past two decades, decentralization has substantially recast center-local relations and been hailed as a means to strengthen local democracy and accountability. However, decentralization has also faced significant challenges in implementation across the vast Indonesian archipelago. 

As a far-reaching political process, decentralization has impacted regional autonomy, public services, resource allocation, elections, political participation, and power dynamics across this diverse nation. Examining decentralization sheds important light on Indonesia's post-Suharto political landscape.

## Definitions of Decentralization

Decentralization involves transferring authority and responsibility from the central government to local governmental entities. There are three main types of decentralization:

**Political Decentralization** - This involves the transfer of political power and authority to subnational levels. It allows citizens to elect their own local representatives and enables local governments to have autonomy over decision-making in their jurisdiction. Political decentralization aims to give citizens more direct control over governance.

**Administrative Decentralization** - This refers to the transfer of responsibility for planning, financing, and management of public functions from the central government to local governments and agencies. The goal is to redistribute administrative workload and increase efficiency. Local authorities get more discretion in implementing policies, rules, and regulations.

**Fiscal Decentralization** - This entails the decentralization of financial resources and authority. Local governments are given greater control over expenditures, revenue collection, and budgeting. The transfer of financial decision-making powers is intended to allow local authorities to better address the needs and priorities of their constituents.

Decentralization aims to distribute governance responsibilities across different levels of administration and bring decision-making closer to citizens. The extent and balance across these types of decentralization shape governance dynamics.

## Decentralization Under Dutch Colonial Rule

The Dutch colonial government implemented a system linking central and local governments. Under this two-tier system, central government officials were deployed locally but retained control over residents in their jurisdictions. While ultimate authority rested with the central colonial rulers, some basic administration and service provision responsibilities were delegated to local leaders. 

This system aimed to enhance efficiency by utilizing local intermediaries for basic governance while maintaining Dutch oversight and authority. Local leaders had some fiscal responsibilities for their jurisdictions but lacked true autonomy.

The Dutch also initiated the Ethical Policy during the early 20th century, which aimed to lighten the economic and fiscal burden on localities by involving them in limited decision-making and administration. While the Ethical Policy represented a very modest shift, the fundamental two-tier system connecting central colonial and local administration persisted until it was abolished in 1957 under the Basic Law on Local Administration enacted by the new Indonesian government following independence.

## Post-Independence Centralization

Following independence, Indonesia initially retained the two-tier system established under Dutch colonial rule, which linked the central government to local administrative units. However, in 1957 the enactment of the Basic Law on Local Administration led to the abolishment of this two-tier system. 

Under the new law, local assemblies and heads of government were eliminated. Local administrators became part of the central government bureaucracy, functioning as agents of the central government rather than representatives of local interests. This reflected the dominance of Javanese political elites and centralized autocratic rule under President Sukarno.

The 1957 law thus marked a shift towards centralization in Indonesia in the post-independence period. Local autonomy and administration were subsumed under central authority. This unitary system concentrated power in the hands of central government officials. Local needs and aspirations took a backseat, as local administrators were appointed by and reported to the central bureaucracy rather than local residents.

## Post-Suharto Decentralization Reforms

The decentralization process accelerated in Indonesia following the fall of Suharto's authoritarian New Order regime in 1998 amidst economic, political and social crises. Significant political reforms promoting regional autonomy and decentralization were undertaken, guided by key legislation including Law No. 22/1999 on Regional Governments and Law No. 25/1999 on Fiscal Balance between the Central Government and Regional Governments. 

The motivations for these reforms were multifaceted. One major aim was to address the discontent in the regions and curb secessionist movements in resource-rich provinces like Aceh and Papua by granting greater autonomy. Decentralization was also seen as a way to correct the structural imbalance resulting from decades of highly centralized power focused on Java under Suharto's rule.

The new laws ushered in major changes to center-region relations. Direct local elections were mandated for regional heads and legislative council members. An open candidacy framework enabled direct public participation. Independent regional governments assumed authority over public services like health and education. Most importantly, fiscal decentralization granted regional governments control over a larger share of revenues, empowering them economically.

Overall, these reforms represented a radical shift towards democratization, accountability and empowerment of regional governments in the post-Suharto period. By devolving political, administrative and fiscal powers to subnational units, decentralization aimed to enhance participatory policymaking, service delivery, resource allocation, and realization of local aspirations. However, significant challenges remained.

## Outcomes of Decentralization

Decentralization reforms in Indonesia aimed to strengthen democracy and accountability but also brought some challenges.

One major outcome was the introduction of direct elections for regional heads and legislative bodies. This opened opportunities for greater political participation and leadership at the local level. Indonesians could now directly choose their own regional representatives rather than have them appointed from Jakarta.

However, decentralization did not automatically translate into full local accountability. Although elected local officials are in theory accountable to constituents, patronage networks and entrenched power dynamics can persist. There are still issues with transparency and responsiveness.

Additionally, the division of powers between national, provincial, and district governments remains unclear in some domains. This contributes to problems of overlapping authorities and fiscal limitations for regional governments. 

Service delivery has been impacted as well. While decentralization empowered regions to address local needs, capacity gaps emerged in social services like health and education. Regional governments struggled to effectively budget, coordinate, and maintain service quality.

Overall, democratic decentralization has been a mixed bag. It opened new opportunities for political participation but endemic issues around accountability, governance, and capacity remain works in progress. As with any major institutional reform, realizing the full benefits takes sustained commitment, resources, and cultural change.

## Role of Political Parties

Political parties play a crucial role in Indonesia's decentralized landscape. The country has a multi-party system, with parties needing to secure votes across a dispersed archipelago to gain power. This promotes national aggregation and coalition-building.  

Parties provide the primary linkage between national and local politics. They nominate candidates for regional head elections and develop patronage networks. Strong local party organizations are key for electoral mobilization and monitoring local officials.

Given decentralization, parties cannot simply rely on a centralized patronage system. They must appeal to diverse local interests through adaptable policy platforms and credible local leaders. Parties able to successfully build alliances across the nation and penetrate the grassroots tend to thrive electorally.

Central party leaders distribute resources to maintain nationwide party cohesion and discipline. But decentralization provides local elites more autonomy in managing patronage resources, weakening central control. Tensions can emerge between national and local party interests.

Overall, parties play an instrumental role in national integration, aggregating diverse preferences and facilitating representation. Their structures and strategies have adapted alongside decentralization reforms. Parties continue maneuvering to balance central power with flexibility for provincial and district leaders.

# Future Prospects

The future of decentralization in Indonesia will depend on several key factors. Most importantly, the success of local democracy and governance will determine if decentralization continues and deepens. Indonesia needs strong, accountable local leaders that can deliver results for citizens through transparent and participatory governance. Regional autonomy and decentralization will only work if local officials are democratically elected and focused on serving community needs. 

Local governments also must demonstrate good governance marked by responsibility, effectiveness, openness, coherence, accountability and respect for the rule of law. With greater autonomy comes greater responsibility to meet basic needs like healthcare, education, infrastructure and economic development. Regions that fail to deliver public services and opportunities risk fueling resentment and unrest.

Finally, improving public services will be essential for decentralization to gain further support. Despite reforms, service delivery has been uneven across Indonesia. While some districts excel, others continue to perform poorly in areas like education and maternal healthcare. Closing these gaps will require increased funding, better policies, and delivery innovations tailored to local contexts. With strong local democracy and governance, decentralization can enable wider access to quality public services.

The trajectory of decentralization thus depends on local leaders embracing participatory democracy, accountable governance and people-centered policies. If regional autonomy can demonstrably improve lives across Indonesia's diverse landscapes, decentralization will have a bright future. But the path ahead requires dedicated local stewards of democracy and development.

## Money Politics and Electoral Implications

The use of money to secure political support, referred to as "Money Politics," has significantly influenced electoral dynamics in Indonesia. Two key concepts relevant to money politics are patronage and clientelism. 

Patronage involves politicians distributing benefits like cash, jobs, projects or preferential access to services in exchange for political support and votes from citizens. These benefits act as divisible incentives that politicians rely on to build their power base. The patron (politician) provides selected benefits to clients (voters) in return for political allegiance.

Clientelism refers to a reciprocal, hierarchical and iterative relationship between patrons and clients. It is a more personalistic form of power relationship compared to pure patronage. Clientelism requires repeated interactions and involves norms of reciprocity where patrons provide concrete rewards and clients reciprocate with political support and votes. However, not all patronage relationships exhibit the core features of genuine clientelism.

The prevalence of money politics and clientelism in Indonesia can be traced to factors like a lack of strong programmatic parties, personalized power structures, income and development disparities, and weak formal institutions. These dynamics shape both national and local electoral landscapes.

At the national level, party elites distribute patronage resources to build loyalty networks. Locally, candidates cultivate patron-client networks, relying on brokers to mobilize voters. Citizens often view patronage as supplemental income rather than unethical or corrupt. 

Vote buying and the distribution of club goods like donations to community projects are some common money politics practices. These affect citizens' voting behavior and electoral outcomes, undermining democratic ideals of accountability. Tackling money politics requires strengthening institutions, campaign finance reforms and reducing socioeconomic disparities that perpetuate clientelism.

## Conclusion

Decentralization has been an important part of Indonesia's democratization process in the post-Suharto era. The reforms to decentralize power and authority aimed to curb separatism, address over-centralization in Java, and strengthen local governance and accountability. 

However, the outcomes have been mixed. Overlapping authorities, financial constraints, and issues with transparency and accountability at the local level continue to pose challenges. The role of political parties within decentralized governance has also been crucial and complex. Money politics and patronage relationships have influenced elections.

Looking ahead, the future of effective decentralization depends on strengthening local democracy, improving public services, ensuring good governance, and enhancing cooperation across levels of government. The end goal is to foster participatory, accountable governance that is responsive to local needs across Indonesia's diverse regions.  

If thoughtfully implemented, decentralization can support democratization, equitable development, and unity amidst diversity in Indonesia. But continued reform is needed to fully realize its potential benefits. The interplay between local and national governance will shape the next chapter of Indonesia's political evolution.

## The Complex Political Landscape of Developing Nations

In many developing countries, the complex intersection of political and economic tensions poses a significant challenge. Governments often escape accountability, corruption thrives, and certain segments of society remain inadequately represented. These issues stem from the unique pressures and dynamics that shape the political landscape of developing nations. 

Urbanization and rising education levels contribute to heightened political awareness, particularly among previously non-politicized populations. As more citizens demand political and economic participation, the system struggles to accommodate them. This places strain on political institutions and can lead to unrest if left unaddressed.  

Developing nations must find ways to build more inclusive, transparent, and accountable political systems. Doing so will empower citizens, reduce corruption, and ultimately create a more just society. It is a difficult task, but a worthy challenge that developing nations must undertake.

# Huntington's Prediction of Heightened Political Awareness Proves Accurate

In many developing countries, urbanization and rising education levels are contributing to heightened political awareness, particularly among previously non-politicized populations. 

As these countries undergo economic development and modernization, there are increasing migration flows from rural to urban areas. This rapid urbanization brings large populations together in cities, fostering information exchange and raising awareness of political issues. With greater access to media, technology, and diverse viewpoints in urban environments, people become more politically engaged.

Similarly, as education levels increase in developing nations, citizens become more informed and develop greater interest in the political process. Public schooling exposes individuals to civic concepts, enabling them to better understand their rights and responsibilities. Higher education provides analytical skills to critically assess political leaders and policies.  

Overall, Huntington's prediction that urbanization and education would lead to heightened political awareness in the developing world has proven accurate. These socioeconomic changes have galvanized previously marginalized groups and intensified demands on political systems. Managing the rising political engagement of newly aware citizens poses an ongoing challenge for governments in developing countries.

## Women Political Leaders 

The 20th century saw the rise of many exceptional women to the highest political leadership roles across the globe. Most notable among them were figures like Indira Gandhi, who served as Prime Minister of India for nearly two decades and remains the country's only female premier thus far. 

As daughter of India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhi grew up immersed in politics. After years of supporting her father and serving in various roles within the Indian National Congress party, she went on to become Prime Minister in 1966. Gandhi would serve multiple terms leading India, making bold moves like authorizing a nuclear test in 1974 and initiating a state of emergency from 1975 to 1977. She became known internationally as a champion for developing nations. Tragically, Gandhi was assassinated by her own bodyguards in 1984 while still in office.

Other groundbreaking women leaders of the era were Isabel Perón of Argentina, who was the world's first female president, as well as Corazon Aquino of the Philippines, who restored democracy after the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. Overall, the 20th century marked a major shift in women rising to power on the global political stage and reaching new heights of leadership.

## Indonesia's History of Women's Participation 

Indonesia has a rich history of women's participation in politics. In 1928, the inaugural Women Congress was held, marking an important milestone for women's political involvement. Over time, women gained increasing representation through the 1955 elections during parliamentary democracy, the New Order era under Suharto's presidency, and in the post-New Order period after Suharto's resignation in 1998. 

Significant progress came in 2004 with the implementation of a 30% quota system for women's representation in the national parliament. This affirmative action policy helped increase the number of women parliamentarians at the national level, though it has been less effective at boosting women's participation at the local level. Overall, Indonesian women have made important strides in political participation throughout the nation's history, from the early Women Congress to the contemporary quota system. Challenges remain, but the long-term trend points to expanding roles for women in Indonesia's political landscape.

## Advancements for Indonesian Women

Indonesia has seen several advancements for women's political participation in recent decades. One of the most notable was the implementation of a 30% quota system for women in 2004. This quota mandated that 30% of a political party's candidates and parliamentary seats must be filled by women. 

The quota system has significantly increased the number of women in parliament. In the 2004 election, women won 11.3% of parliamentary seats, up from 8% in the previous election. By 2009, this percentage had jumped to 18%, largely attributed to the quota. While Indonesia has yet to reach the 30% target, the quota represents an important affirmative action policy to improve women's political representation.

Additional progress includes granting voting rights to women in 1946 and allowing women to stand for election in 1952. With the quota system and growing societal openness to women leaders, female participation in Indonesian politics continues to expand. However, persistent challenges like cultural norms, internal party dynamics, and familial expectations demonstrate the need for further advancement.

## Cultural Barriers

In Indonesia, cultural norms often act as impediments to women's political participation and leadership. Traditional gender roles portray women as subordinate and limit their acceptance in positions of power. Many elements of culture reinforce the notion that women belong in the domestic sphere caring for family rather than the public sphere of governance and leadership. These norms can be pervasive, shaping social expectations and making it difficult for women to be seen as legitimate political candidates and leaders.

Indonesian culture has strong patriarchal roots, contributing to attitudes that politics is primarily a man's domain. The perceived traits of a good leader are also heavily skewed toward masculine qualities like assertiveness, competitiveness and dominance. Women in leadership threaten traditional concepts of power and authority. They may face questions over their toughness, capability to handle crises, and ability to command respect from subordinates. Overcoming such cultural barriers requires shifting mindsets on appropriate social roles for women as well as the attributes of leadership.

## Internal Party Dynamics

Within political parties themselves, existing power structures and internal systems often perpetuate gender biases that hinder the progress of women in politics. Leadership positions are disproportionately held by men, who may actively or passively resist initiatives to increase women's leadership roles. Patriarchal norms become deeply embedded within party culture and operations.  

Many political parties lack strong policies and mechanisms to recruit, support, and promote female candidates. Women seeking leadership positions or nominations to run for office frequently encounter obstacles related to lower perceived competence, exclusion from influential networks and activities, and lack of structural accommodations for women's needs. Overcoming ingrained organizational inertia and entrenched mindsets presents an ongoing struggle.

Transforming internal party dynamics requires multifaceted approaches. Policies mandating minimum proportions of female party officials and political candidates can provide impetus for change. Robust mentoring, training, and advancement programs focused on women establish structural pipelines and address skill gaps. visibly modeling diversity in leadership posts signals an inclusive culture. Flexible meeting times and childcare help enable women's participation. Continual advocacy and pressure from reform-minded members keeps gender equity on the agenda. Fundamentally, parties must critically examine biases in order to cultivate more egalitarian ethos and practices over the long term.

## Family Obligations

In Indonesia, family obligations present a significant barrier for women seeking political leadership positions. Traditional gender norms often dictate that a woman's primary role is in the domestic sphere, caring for children and managing the household. Many women face resistance from husbands, parents, and extended family when considering political careers, as politics is still widely seen as part of the male domain. 

The expectations to be primary caregivers and run households put extensive demands on women's time and energy. Politics requires long work hours and extensive travel, which is difficult to balance with family duties. Women considering politics may face discouragement from family members who worry it will detract from their ability to properly care for children and fulfill other familial responsibilities.

Cultural attitudes that politics is not an appropriate path for women also lead many families to actively dissuade women from pursuing leadership positions. In a society where women are expected to put family first, their ambitions beyond the home may be criticized. Many women opt not to pursue political careers to avoid family conflict and maintain harmony.

Overcoming entrenched gender roles and shifting cultural mentalities is key to enabling more women to take on political leadership in Indonesia. Unless families become more supportive of women's political aspirations, family obligations will continue deterring capable female leaders. Greater education and advocacy efforts to promote more progressive gender attitudes could foster an environment where women feel empowered to take on public leadership roles.

## Awareness and Education

Limited political awareness and educational disparities present additional obstacles for women pursuing leadership roles in Indonesia. Many women, especially those in rural areas, lack access to civic education programs teaching the fundamentals of political engagement. Without a foundational understanding of political systems and processes, participating meaningfully becomes difficult. Educational limitations also factor into the equation, as Indonesian women have lower literacy rates and fewer opportunities for advanced studies compared to men. 

Pursuing political office requires a certain degree of education and political know-how. To increase women's representation, grassroots educational initiatives focused on political literacy are essential. Existing programs led by civil society groups demonstrate the power of targeted education in empowering women and girls to become more politically active. Expanding these efforts, alongside boosting educational attainment overall, will open more doors for women to take on leadership positions. Greater awareness and education serve as key steps toward achieving gender parity in Indonesia's political realm.

# The Beginning of Women Representative in Indonesian Political System

Ten years after Indonesia independence, there was a first general election that was held in 1955 and will be always held every five years after that. The numbers of political parties which enter the election always different and that makes different calculation of women participation (Parawansa, 2005). The election of 1955 has been called to be the first opening for Indonesian women to be representative in parliament, there are seven candidates came from women’s organization and a few from political parties which made 17 women are elected to the legislation (Parawansa, 2005).

In New Order era when Soeharto become the president, Indonesia use a single party which is a major party is a dominant one, and women representation are determined by the party-elites because they can’t do anything if they don’ have anyone who strong enough to bring them to the top, so the candidates must be have close relationship with the elites, also in this era, women don’t involved directly in election campaign and they there is a gap between the candidates and the voters. (Parawansa, 2005).

End of the New Order regime is the start of reformation in Indonesia, the first election in 1999 has result that 45 women are elected with total number 500 of DPR members also there are not so much difference from provincial election which is in East Java parliament just have 11 women in parliament out of 100 members. (Siregar, 2005). It’s conclude, in Indonesia, women participation in politic still low after post-new order. Women participation in several Indonesia province are less than 30 percent and some of the provinces are less than 10 percent legislators are women (Rhoads, 2012).

With the new regulation on women participation in politics that is a 30 percent quota for women legislative candidate and a 30 percent quota for women in party leadership had been made in 2003 (Rhoads, 2012), even there is a chance for women enter political arena in Indonesia, the rate of women representation in legislature still remained low.

## Case study: Women Representation in Local Parliament

Bali, was the lowest rate of women participation in politics. Even there is Balinese women run for the candidate in 2009, there is no women are elected for national legislature. In Indonesia context, women are the least represented at the local parliament, in total there are just 12 percent of all regional legislator from 491 district in Indonesia and in Bali, there are just make 7 percent of district level legislator. Many factors lead the reason why there are a few women in Indonesia political system that will be more describe in the next topic.

Slightly different from national parliament, the representative from East Java parliament was little bit higher from national parliament in the period 1982-1987 while the lowest was 10.5 percent. But, the similarity between East Java regional and national parliamentary was the highest women representative is during the time of Soeharto government.

In the Sidoarjo parliament, the highest percentage is 14.8 percent in 1956-1957, meanwhile the lowest was 4.4 percent is in the period 1999-2004. Different from the East Java regional and national parliamentary that the lowest percentage was during Sukarno Era (1945-1965), the Siduarjo parliament has the lowest percentage during reform era (1998 onwards). It means, the decentralization of district did not always improve the representation of women in Siduarjo.

From the Soekarno government in 1945, women representation in parliaments in Indonesia did not significantly improve, but there was a strong motivation for women activist to demand greater chance for woman in 2004 elections.

### Women Struggle for Becoming Member of Parliament

Parliament is have a job to represent all the society, they are the representative of Indonesia citizens, but most of parliament members are men and just a few of woman. It become the challenge of Indonesian government to take this problem serious because Indonesia is using democratization system in the government it means all people can be parliament if they are compatible to doing that. In 2004 election, many women is taken in place which they can’t win, the example is they being placed far down the party list which is the chances for being elected is low. 

 Indonesian cultures also still deeply into patronage, money politics, also patriarchal. All parties expect to provide goods in return for votes in election. Money politics is often happening in political campaign for general election, such as patron-client relationship. The patron often is the candidate from the party and it use broker or tim sukses who offers goods or services to the client. The barrier of the women to enter political party is because of the high cost with limited public funding.

  In Indonesia, awareness of gender and equality and justice issues is still low and most of people still patriarchal about women roles. Based on the survey in 2012 by CSIS, 86,3 percent of respondents agrees that women could work outside of home but have primary job that take care of household. That mean, Indonesia doesn’t trust women to take a lead, they still think that man should be the leader.
  
### The Future of Women Representation in Politic

There are a few major associations of women’s organization which can help to increase representation of women in parliament such as Kongres Wanita Indonesia (KOWANI) and BMOIWI (Federation of Indonesian Muslim Women Organizations). If that organization can work together effectively, it can increase women representation. To increasing and promoting women participation in electoral process, the International Foundation for Electoral System with Center for Political Studies (PUSKAPOL) University of Indonesia worked with KPU and Elections Supervisory Agency (BAWASLU) to promote women’s representative to electoral management bodies.

The other ways to increasing the representation of women in political parties is by introducing the quota system within political parties and ensuring that women have chance in political parties or become candidate for general election. But, there is no use if woman had no skill to become candidate, so its needed to empowering women with education, training and increased access to information.

Effort to women representation must accompanied with the improvement of the democracy quality because parliament must represent all members of society.

## Conclusion: Steps Needed to Increase Women's Political Participation 

While Indonesian women have made important strides, more work remains to foster women's full participation and leadership in the political sphere. Key steps needed include:

- Changing cultural mindsets and attitudes to promote the acceptance of women leaders
- Reforming internal party processes to be more equitable and inclusive 
- Providing support systems that enable women to balance family obligations
- Launching civic engagement programs to increase women's political awareness
- Expanding educational opportunities for girls and women
- Allocating funding and resources to empower women candidates

The path forward requires a comprehensive, coordinated effort across all levels of society. From grassroots advocacy to policy reforms, impactful change hinges on a collective commitment to gender equity as a core value. With ongoing persistence and unity, Indonesian women can achieve equal representation and voice in the political realm.

<exercise id="8" title="Religion, Society And Politics">

## Introduction

Since 2005, Indonesia has witnessed numerous direct elections of local government heads in provinces, districts, and municipalities. A notable trend in these elections is the formation of ethnic coalitions, with political party activists asserting that voters tend to favor candidates from the same ethnic background, particularly when their group constitutes a significant majority in the region. This phenomenon has resulted in a notable convergence between ethnic population patterns and ethnic identity, as highlighted by scholars like Edward Aspinall, Sebastian Dettman, and Eve Warburton.

## Religion and Politics

The intertwining of religion and politics has been a subject of scrutiny in Indonesia. President Joko Widodo proposed a separation of religion and politics during the Jakarta gubernatorial run-off election. Religious leaders, such as Mustofa Bisri and Quraish Shihab, attribute the rise of a hardline understanding of Islam to the presence of leaders claiming a monopoly on truth. 

Emphasizing the need for constant re-examination and re-learning of religious texts, religious leaders argue for a nuanced interpretation relevant to the contemporary context. Mustofa Bisri contends that no one can claim a monopoly on interpreting religious texts. He highlights the importance of exercising wisdom and embedding values like justice, compassion and humanity when examining scripture. 

Similarly, Quraish Shihab advocates for a contextual understanding of religious texts, taking into account the socio-historical circumstances in which they were revealed. He cautions against a rigid reading and asserts that Islam respects freedom of thought and democratic values. According to Shihab, religion should shape ethics and morality, not politics.

Leaders like Bisri and Shihab provide a counterpoint to hardline voices, advocating nuance over dogma. Their perspectives showcase the diversity of religious thought in Indonesia, beyond those claiming a monopoly on truth. By emphasizing contextual relevance, they attempt to curb the weaponization of religion for political ends.

## Medan Case Study:

Medan provides an interesting case study into the interplay between identity politics and communal tensions in local elections. In the city's recent run-off mayoral election, communal solidarity and religious affiliations emerged as more pronounced factors than ethnic considerations. 

This was highlighted in the campaigns of Sofyan Tan, a minority Buddhist, and Rahudman Harahap, a Muslim candidate. Despite their different ethnic and religious backgrounds, Tan received significant support from Muslim voters while Harahap drew support across ethnic lines. This phenomenon of **"identity switching" reflects the complexities of identity politics in Medan's diverse society.**

Rather than voting solely along ethnic lines, Medan's citizens displayed **communal solidarity that crossed ethnic factors.** Religious affiliations and perceived moral integrity proved decisive. Candidates who could appeal across ethnic and religious divides gained an advantage. 

Medan's diverse religious makeup, with Protestant Toba Bataks, Muslim Mandailing Bataks, and variations within the Malay community, showcases this **unique interplay between identity politics and tensions.** In the fluidity of the political arena, group identities are strategically emphasized and de-emphasized. But ultimately, overarching communal solidarity triumphed over narrow ethnic interests in Medan.

## Diverse Religious Landscape

Medan's diverse religious makeup highlights the intricate dynamics of identity politics in Indonesia. The city has a large **Toba Batak** population, who are predominantly **Protestant Christians**. The **Mandailing Batak** community, on the other hand, is largely **Muslim**. 

There are also variations within the broader Batak and Malay groups in Medan. This diverse religious landscape serves as a microcosm of Indonesia's complex patchwork of ethnic and religious identities.

Political actors must navigate and appeal to this multifaceted social fabric. The intermingling of ethnicity and religion means political mobilization involves strategic emphasis and selection of identities. Candidates build coalitions by appealing to specific ethnic and religious blocs at opportune moments.

Medan thus showcases how identity can be fluid and instrumental in the political sphere. As groups converge and split over ethnic, religious and other affiliations, political entrepreneurs manipulate identity politics to gain electoral advantage. This highlights the nuances and difficulties of managing diversity in Indonesian democracy.

## Strategic Identity Politics

In the religiously and ethnically diverse city of Medan, political actors strategically emphasize particular identities to gain maximum political advantage. This phenomenon highlights the malleability of identity in the political sphere. 

During elections in Medan, candidates form coalitions and appeal to specific ethnic or religious groups that can provide a strong voter base. For example, Sofyan Tan, a Buddhist candidate, aligned with Muslim leader Rahudman Harahap to broaden his voter appeal. Tan emphasized his Chinese heritage when campaigning in Chinese communities, but downplayed it in Muslim areas, showcasing how politicians modulate ethnic and religious identities for political gain.

The diverse Medan electorate leads candidates to strategically accentuate aspects of their identity that resonate most with different voter demographics. Identities are not fixed, but can be reframed and emphasized situationally to build coalitions and consolidate power. As evidenced in Medan, identity is malleable in the political arena, with actors selecting and projecting identities instrumentally to maximize electoral advantage. The strategic mutability of identity politics in Indonesia's diverse society is exemplified in microcosm in Medan.

## Conclusions

Medan provides an insightful microcosm for understanding the broader patterns of ethnic and religious politics in Indonesia. With its diverse mix of ethnicities and faiths, Medan highlights the complex interplay between identity politics and electoral mobilization in the country. 

The strategic emphasis on certain identity markers during elections, as seen through the Medan case study, showcases how identities can be fluid and malleable in the political sphere. Political actors selectively utilize religious, ethnic, or other markers of identity that give them the most electoral advantage.

This phenomenon reveals the need for nuanced examination of identity issues in diverse societies like Indonesia. Simple narratives or assumptions should be avoided, given the multifaceted nature of identity. As Medan demonstrates, the dynamics of identity and electoral politics involve complex factors of history, demography, communal relations, and more.

Moving forward, the intertwining of religion and politics in Indonesia requires thoughtful analysis that avoids polarization. Nuanced understanding of the country's diverse identities and their role in the political arena will be crucial. Medan provides one glimpse into these intricate dynamics, but much more examination is needed of the complex relationship between identity politics and democracy across Indonesia. Most importantly, the diverse voices within each identity group must be heard in order to develop holistic solutions that serve the shared interests of all communities.
