<exercise id="1" title="Introduction To International Relations Theories">  



The study of international relations (IR) emerged as an academic discipline after World War I as scholars and practitioners sought to understand the conditions that led to the "World War" and how future wars could be prevented. Since then, IR has evolved from its early idealist roots into a diverse field encompassing multiple theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches.

## Ontology, Epistemology and Methodology 

Each theoretical position in IR revolves around assumptions concerning ontology, epistemology, and methodology. Ontology refers to the nature of reality and what constitutes the fundamental building blocks of the social world. Epistemology examines how we can come to know this reality and the possibility of gaining objective knowledge. Methodology involves the techniques used to uncover and analyze information about world politics. 

While positivism, a prevailing philosophy of science, has long dominated IR scholarship, particularly in the United States, its recent discrediting as a scientific practice does not diminish its historical significance in shaping the discipline. Positivism assumes an objective, observable reality exists independently of observers. Knowledge derives from sensory experience of this external reality. The social world functions according to generalizable laws analogous to the natural sciences. Positivism favors quantitative, empirical methods for uncovering causal explanations and predictive laws.

In contrast, post-positivist approaches in IR question the existence of an observer-independent reality. Social phenomena have inherently subjective qualities not governed by immutable laws. Post-positivism emphasizes understanding the contextual meaning of events, using qualitative methods interpretive of subjective human experiences. 

Divergent meta-theoretical assumptions between positivism and post-positivism have fueled pivotal debates within IR on what constitutes scientific study and whether the field qualifies as a science. The different positions in IR carry distinct ontological, epistemological and methodological viewpoints that shape how theorists conceptualize and study global politics.

## Positivism and IR 

Positivism, a prevailing philosophy of science, has long dominated IR scholarship, particularly in the United States. As a school of thought, positivism emphasizes empirical data and scientific methods, holding that authentic knowledge is based on experience of natural phenomena and their properties and relations. Positivism rejects speculation based on spiritual or metaphysical sources and maintains that research should be value-free and objective. 

In IR, positivism influenced efforts to establish the field as an empirical science, favoring quantitative methods and statistical analysis. Positivism shaped theoretical work seeking to identify universal causal explanations and generalizable patterns, aligned with principles of logic and empiricism. This approach enabled IR scholars to construct theoretical models and derive testable hypotheses about state behavior and world politics.

However, positivism's standing as a credible scientific framework has weakened, as critics have highlighted limitations in its core assumptions. Post-positivism maintains that pure objectivity is impossible and that observations remain theory-laden. Social constructionism argues that the social environment influences our perceptions and sense of reality. Interpretivism emphasizes understanding meanings and subjective experiences rather than external causes. 

These critiques have undermined positivism and sparked vigorous debates about appropriate scientific methods in studying global politics. While positivism retains influence, its dominance has diminished. Yet its historical role in shaping IR as an academic discipline remains significant.

## Defining IR as a Science 

Two pivotal meta-theoretical questions have persistently defined IR: what constitutes the scientific study of world politics and the perennial debate over whether IR qualifies as a science. IR scholars have long wrestled with defining the field as a science, sparking significant debates over what constitutes scientific study and rigor when analyzing global politics and relations between states. 

Many have critiqued IR as failing to meet key criteria of a science, lacking theoretical coherence, an agreed upon methodology, or defined boundaries as an academic discipline. The complexity of international relations, with countless variables interacting in dynamic and unpredictable ways, poses challenges for systematic theory building and testing. IR's subject matter - the behavior of states driven by national interests and power - is difficult to measure and quantify precisely. 

However, defenders argue IR utilizes rigorous methods of hypothesis testing, statistical analysis, and modeling rooted in scientific rationalism. The prominence of quantitative approaches and formal modeling reflect IR's scientific aspirations. While lacking the precision of natural sciences, IR develops contingent generalizations and applies scientific logic in studying world politics. The debate continues between those arguing IR cannot attain the standards of a true science versus others believing it has evolved into a mature, replicable discipline. How IR negotiates scientific norms and objectivity versus interpretive methods shapes the field's scope and impact.

## First Great Debate 

The First Great Debate emerged during and after World War I, pitting **idealists against realists**. Idealists advocated for institutions and reason to control human irrationalities that they believed had led to the Great War, while realists critiqued them for focusing on how the world "ought to be" rather than pragmatically addressing objective realities. 

The idealists, led by figures like Woodrow Wilson, supported the establishment of international organizations like the League of Nations to promote cooperation, collective security, and the peaceful resolution of disputes between nations. They believed that binding rules, norms and institutions could overcome selfish national interests and aggression.

In contrast, realists like E.H. Carr rejected these ideas as naive and utopian. They argued that power politics and national self-interest necessarily shape state behavior in an anarchic international system lacking a supreme authority. Rather than imagining an ideal world, realists focused on world politics as it existed, emphasizing power, military capabilities and the balance of power between nation-states. 

This seminal debate helped define the contours of the nascent field of IR, with idealism fading as realist accounts of WWI proved more compelling to make sense of the interwar period. The Great Debate established realism as the dominant paradigm in IR for decades to come.

## Second Great Debate

The Second Great Debate in the 1960s centered on **methodology**, dividing traditionalists defending a humanistic approach from modernizers pushing for greater methodological rigor. This debate emerged from dissatisfaction with the prevalence of descriptive and philosophical approaches lacking systematic methods of analysis. 

The traditionalists believed the study of IR should focus on historically-oriented, qualitative research to capture the complexity of political life. They emphasized the role of subjective human consciousness and moral purpose in global politics. Traditionalists argued for retaining interdisciplinary flexibility rather than narrow methodological constraints.

In contrast, the modernizers pushed for theoretically-driven empirical research drawing on quantitative methods from economics and other social sciences. They advocated for greater methodological rigor to develop generalizable theoretical explanations of world politics. The modernizers wanted the study of IR to emulate the hard sciences and critiqued traditional approaches as interpretive, philosophical, and insufficiently scientific. 

## Third Great Debate (Inter-Paradigm Debate)

The Third Great Debate in the 1970s and 1980s engaged **realist, pluralist (liberal), and globalist (marxist)** positions in understanding and explaining international processes.

The realist position asserted that states were motivated by self-interest and the pursuit of power in an anarchic world where there was no overarching authority to regulate their interactions and they viewed International Relations through a prism of competitive relations. Realists emphasized nation-state sovereignty and saw international institutions and organizations as epiphenomenal or marginal phenomena inasmuch as they did not directly influence state behavior. 

Pluralists challenged realism by suggesting that states were not the only relevant actors in international politics. Pluralists pointed to the existence and growing influence of non-state and transnational actors and their interactions with states. They emphasized examining relationships among these various types of actors to understand global politics. They also acknowledge realist perspective but also advocated the mutual benefits for states through greater cooperative relations.

Globalist critiqued both realists and pluralists for taking the state-centric framework of international politics for granted, and for ignoring capitalism's influence on economic and social structures, as well as conflicts stemming from economic classes. Marxists advocated analyzing global capitalism's impacts on international relations and conflicts between states and other actors.

## Fourth Great Debate

The Fourth Debate, characterizing IR since the mid-1980s, involves deep-seated disagreements on what the discipline should study and how. This debate emerged as positivism's dominance as the primary philosophy of science in IR began to erode. It can be characterized in many ways: as a debate between explaining (scientific) and understanding (interpretive), between positivism (empiricist) and post-positivism and between rationalism and reflectivism.

On one side of the debate are explanatory theorists, who align with positivism and believe IR should seek to identify general causal relationships and laws that can explain international processes and events. These scholars aim to test hypotheses and build empirical models to explain phenomena like interstate wars, alliance formations, or economic agreements.

On the other side are interpretive scholars, who argue that IR should focus more on understanding social life and the internal meanings created by social actors. Interpretivists reject the positivist notion that the social world can be studied like the natural/physical world. They emphasize the importance of subjective beliefs, perceptions, shared meanings, and social constructs. 

While explanatory theorists align with quantitative methods, interpretivists promote qualitative approaches centered on social meanings. This methodological divide underpins the substantive disagreements over what IR should study and how. The Fourth Debate brought these longstanding tensions between positivism and post-positivist alternatives to the fore in IR.

## Conceptions of IR Theory

There are divergent conceptions of what constitutes a theory in international relations scholarship. These include:

- **Explanatory Theories** - Seek to identify general causes and effects, make predictions, and provide explanations. Aligned with positivism. Example theories are realism, liberalism, and Marxism.
- **Critical Theories** - Challenge prevailing theoretical orthodoxies and aim to reveal structures of power and domination. Associated with the Frankfurt School. 
- **Normative Theories** - Make value judgements about ideal models for political order and justice. Prescriptive in nature.
- **Reflectivist/Interpretive Theories** - Emphasize understanding meanings, reasons, and subjective experiences rather than causes and effects. Associated with constructivism and post-structuralism.
- **Constitutive Theories** - Argue identities and interests are constructed through social interaction, rather than given prior to it. 

There are divergent views on issues like objectivity, theory testing, and the relationship between theory and practice. This underscores the importance of considering meta-theoretical issues and assumptions in evaluating IR theories. Different conceptions of theory play crucial roles in shaping the IR discipline.

## Classical Realism Core Concepts

Classical Realism introduces several key concepts that shape its worldview:

### Groupism

Groupism refers to the significance of human groups, especially nation-states and nationalism, for survival in the realist perspective. It emphasizes that states are the principal actors in global politics and that nationalism binds people together under a common identity to form these coherent groups. Alliance formation between states is an extension of groupism.

### Egoism

Egoism is the view that self-interest is the driving motivator behind political behavior. Classical realists see egoism as rooted in human nature - people and states seek to promote their own interests above others. Egoism manifests in the rational pursuit of national interests by states in the international arena.

### Power-centrism

Power-centrism, also called hegemony, highlights power inequalities as a fundamental feature of politics and human affairs. The realist world is marked by some states exerting greater power and influence over others. Power dynamics shape relationships between states as they seek security and influence.

These interlinked concepts form the building blocks of how classical realists understand global politics and inform their perspective emphasize the primacy of the nation-state and national interests in an environment where power determines outcomes. The rational calculation of interest defined in terms of power is key.

## Main Assumptions of Realism

Realism makes the following key assumptions about international relations:

- States are the principal actors in international affairs. Realism views states as unitary, geographically defined entities that make rational decisions to maximize their security and power. States are the most important units in the global arena.
- The international system is anarchic, lacking any overarching authority. Without a world government, states must ultimately rely on themselves to ensure their continued survival and interests. This creates an environment of self-help and uncertainty.
- States seek to maximize their power and influence relative to others. Power is a means to an end of security and survival. States build up military and economic power to leverage their position and interests internationally.
- The distribution of power is a defining feature of international politics. Realism focuses on the balance of power between states and alliances as a determining factor in international outcomes. Power dynamics constrain and shape state behavior.
- Morality and ideology have little influence in global affairs. Realism maintains that states make foreign policy decisions based on calculations of power and self-interest, not ethical standards. Moral principles do not override strategic considerations.
- Human nature is egoistic and power-driven. Realism has a pessimistic view of human nature, seeing it as inherently competitive and conflictual especially in international anarchy. This shapes how states interact.

## Expanding on Principles of Realism

Classical Realism, as articulated by Hans Morgenthau in his seminal work "Politics Among Nations", expands on the core principles of the Realist perspective in international relations.

Morgenthau emphasizes that Realism is grounded in objective laws rooted in unchanging human nature. He asserts that human nature is selfish, driven by the desire for power and dominance over others. This forms the basis for understanding politics and power dynamics between nation-states.

Additionally, Morgenthau puts forth the concept of looking at and understanding the world through the lens of "interest defined as power". Interests of nation-states in the international arena are primarily viewed through the desire to maximize their own power and influence. Power becomes the main tool through which states pursue their national interests on the global stage.

Finally, Classical Realism stresses the autonomy of the political realm, separate from morality. Morgenthau argues that morality has no place guiding the conduct of nation-states and their foreign policies. The global arena is an amoral space where each state rationally and objectively pursues its interests defined in terms of power. Ethical considerations are set aside in favor of rational calculations around maximizing power.

In summary, Classical Realism expands on key principles of objective laws, interest as power, and the autonomy of politics. These serve as the theoretical foundations for this dominant perspective in analyzing dynamics between nation-states. Power reigns supreme in an anarchic international order with no overarching authority.

## Domestic & International Link

Classical realists blur the distinction between the domestic and international, viewing them as expressions of the same human drives. Thucydides and Morgenthau emphasize the cohesiveness of community in maintaining order and restraint, both domestically and internationally.

A core tenet of classical realism is the connection between domestic politics and international relations. Rather than seeing them as separate spheres, classical realists argue that domestic and foreign affairs are interlinked, stemming from the same root causes in human nature and society.

Specifically, classical realists highlight the role of community in promoting order and restraint within a society as well as between societies. The cohesiveness of communities domestically helps foster shared identities, norms and values that can then underpin stability and cooperation globally. Thucydides emphasized how justice, moderation and shared culture within the Greek city-states enabled alliances and collective action against outside threats.

Similarly, Morgenthau pointed to national unity and vibrant civic participation as critical for order domestically, and for prudent, restrained policies internationally. Strong communities with a sense of shared purpose are a check against unrestrained egoism and power politics. Domestically, this order enables stable state power. Internationally, it facilitates alliances and security bargains between states.

## Balance of Power

The balance of power is an important dynamic in international relations according to the realist perspective. On this topic, there are some notable differences between classical and contemporary realists.

Classical realists like Thucydides emphasize the significance of alliances in maintaining order and stability between states. Alliances allow states to check the power of potential hegemons and prevent any one state from dominating the rest. Thucydides appreciates the complex balancing acts involved in alliance formation and maintenance.

Contemporary realists, on the other hand, prioritize national power over justice and morality in international affairs. From their view, the foremost goal of any state is to maximize its share of world power relative to other states. Alliances are simply means to this end, vehicles for accruing power. Justice and restraint are secondary factors in the contemporary realist's calculations.

So while classical realists see alliances as crucial for order and restraint, contemporary realists view power itself as the primary force in international politics. This divergence highlights an evolution in realist thought from its ancient origins to modern theories of international relations.

# Change & Modernization

Examining change and modernization, classical realists associate change with modernization, bringing shifts in identities and conceptions of security.

Classical realists like Thucydides and Morgenthau recognize that modernization impacts both domestic politics and international relations. As societies modernize, new technologies, economic systems, and cultural values emerge. This can destabilize traditional identities, norms and ideas around security.

For example, the spread of digital technology and social media has rapidly connected people across borders, enabling new transnational identities to form. Globalization of markets has also shifted conceptions of economic security. Climate change is transforming how states think about environmental and energy security.

Classical realists caution that rapid modernization can outpace the ability of institutions and communities to adapt. This is why they advocate judiciously blending old and new values during periods of change, in order to maintain stability and order. Core values around justice and restraint help check leaders' ambitions and build unity.

At the international level, classical realists warn that shifting identities and interests during modernization can exacerbate tensions between states. As relative power changes, status quo powers may cling to old notions of security and attempt to suppress emerging powers. Wise statecraft requires carefully balancing continuity and change across both domestic and international realms.

## Justice in International Relations

For classical realists, justice plays a crucial role in shaping how other states understand and respond to a country. While contemporary realists prioritize power over justice in international affairs, classical realists emphasize justice as essential for maintaining order and restraint both domestically and internationally.

Classical realists like Thucydides appreciate the cohesiveness of community in maintaining order and promoting self-restraint. According to this view, justice enables order by aligning the means and ends of foreign policy with community values. Morgenthau similarly highlights justice as foundational for a stable international system built on order and restraint.

The absence of morality and ethics in the international arena is a core tenet of structural realism. However, classical realists diverge on this point, underscoring justice and morality as ensuring prudent foreign policy aligned with the community's interests. Unjust means often lead to disorder and blowback effects that undermine the ends being pursued.

## Iraq War Case Study

A classical realist perspective provides insight into the tragic outcome of the Iraq War, underscoring the dangers of hubris and the contradiction between a state's proclaimed values and the means used to achieve them.

In the lead-up to the invasion in 2003, the Bush administration displayed tremendous overconfidence, making misplaced assumptions about the Iraqi people's reception of American forces as liberators. This hubris blinded policymakers to the reality that most Iraqis would view the unprovoked invasion of their country as an act of imperialist aggression, not one of liberation.

Furthermore, the ideals behind the war - spreading democracy, protecting human rights - stood in stark contradiction to the means used - an unprovoked invasion justified with manipulated intelligence, the use of torture, the flouting of international law. As classical realists emphasize, justice and community values are crucial for how a state's actions are perceived abroad. By contradicting its own principles, the United States damaged its legitimacy and moral authority.

The tragic aftermath of the Iraq War underscores key warnings from classical realists about the dangers of hubris and the exercise of unrestrained power. Prudence and wisdom are vital to prevent outcomes like Iraq, where the world's most powerful state unleashed horrific devastation in pursuit of idealistic goals using unjust means. The restraint born of caution, humility and respect for shared values serves as an antidote to reckless exercises of power divorced from moral considerations.

<exercise id="3" title="Liberalism">  

- **Analytical units**: State and non-state actors are important
- **View of actors**: State can be disaggregated, some components may function transnationally
- **Behavioral dynamics**: Foreign policy making and transnational processes involve conflict, bargaining, coalition and compromise which means not necessarily resulting in optimal outcomes
- **Issues**: Multiple agendas, socio-economics, welfare as important issue

## Key Assumption

1. The belief in the rational qualities of individuals
2. Faith in the feasibility of progress in the social life
3. The conviction that humans, despite their self-interest, are able to cooperate and construct a more peaceful and harmonious society

---

## Three Set of Liberal Rights

Within the liberal framework, three sets of rights form the foundation. These include:

1. Individual rights to the right to private property
2. Right necessary to protect and promote the capacity of social economy rights
3. Democratic participation or representation

Liberals emphasize the importance of private property rights, believing individuals have a right to own property and engage in market transactions freely. This enables individuals to pursue their economic interests and contributes to an efficient allocation of resources and economic prosperity.

In addition, liberals argue that some rights are necessary to promote social welfare and regulate the economy. These include rights to education, healthcare, social security, and labor regulations. While valuing free markets, liberals contend that governments should provide services and protections to support a thriving economy and society.

Finally, liberals stress democratic participation and representation. Citizens should have the right to elect their leaders and influence government policy. Democratically elected governments, representing the will of the people, can best protect individual liberties. Through voting, civil liberties, and active civic participation, citizens can shape their society.
## Realist Constraint

The realist perspective presents an alternative view of the international system. According to realists, the international arena operates in a state of anarchy, with no overarching authority to govern relations between sovereign states. This creates an inherently competitive environment, where states must be continuously aware of potential threats from other nations.

**Immanuel Kant's** liberal institutionalist perspective contrasts with realism but still accommodates notions of conflict among sovereign states. Kant recognized that states exist in an anarchical system and acknowledged tendencies toward conflict driven by self-interest. However, he believed it was possible to transcend realist constraints through reason.

Kant argued that human nature contains both unsocial and social qualities. Therefore, conflict can be overcome through adherence to universal principles derived from reason. His perspective suggests that shared norms and institutions can facilitate cooperation and restraint even in an anarchical system of states pursuing self-interest.

While realists emphasize power dynamics as the key driver of state behavior, Kant highlighted the role of ideas, principles, and identity. He proposed that republican constitutions with representative governments, rule of law, separation of powers, and protection of civil liberties would promote peaceful external relations. Kant theorized that leaders accountable to their citizens would be constrained from waging aggressive wars.

Furthermore, Kant envisioned increased economic ties between states interdependent through trade and commerce. He posited that these relationships would provide incentives for resolving disputes peacefully to avoid the costs of severed economic links. International organizations could also foster cooperation by establishing norms and offering mechanisms for mediating conflicts.

Therefore, Kant's liberal institutionalism acknowledges the realist view of an anarchical system with self-interested states, but contends that practical reason, shared identities, and growing interdependence can transform state behavior toward more peaceful ends. His perspective accommodates conflict but suggests possibilities to circumvent power dynamics and mitigate tendencies toward war.

## Kantian Triangle

<br>

<center> <img src="modules\Kantian_triangle.png" alt="Kantian Triangle" width="90%" /> </center>

<br>

Kantian Triangle is the illustration of Kantian perspective on world politics, which is about an interdependent system of influences, which are seen to exist in a series of 'feedback loops' with each the major forces strengthening the others. The illustration show that the system directly promoting peace. 

States are less likely to go to war with each other as more of them become **democratic**. When there is a disagreement, democracies usually try to work things out peacefully instead of violently. In turn, this democratic peace leads to more trade and membership in foreign groups.

**Economic interdependence** in the economy also makes war less likely. When countries need each other for trade, raw materials, business, and markets, they have strong reasons to keep the peace. Stopping trade and imposing economic sanctions can cost a lot, so states that rely on each other will try to settle their differences peacefully. Strong rules for foreign trade and investment help keep peace between countries. In addition, democratic nations engage in trade with one another because to the increased likelihood of honoring trade agreements and respecting foreign property rights.

The third pillar is taking part in **international organizations (IO)**. Groups like the UN, WTO, and ICC help states settle disagreements, make decisions about disputes, use penalties to stop aggression, and set up places to negotiate. These institutions make it harder to go to war and easier to reach an agreement. Over time, these norms of teamwork become part of each country's foreign policy. Moreover, beside maintaining the peace, IO also involved in promoting democracy.

When these three forces work together, they make beneficial **feedback loops**. Trade and international organizations work better when there is more democracy. This makes democratic systems stronger. Growing global markets are a reason to make international institutions stronger. When institutions set shared rules and norms, democracies feel safe growing their economic and political ties. All of these factors work together to make the world a more peaceful place.

<exercise id="4" title="Neorealism">  

## Introduction to Structural Realism

Structural realism emerged from classical realism as an approach to understanding international relations that emphasizes the competitive nature of the international system. Whereas classical realists focused on human nature as the root cause of conflict between states, structural realists highlight the anarchic structure of the international system as the key driver of state behavior.

Specifically, structural realists argue that in an **anarchic system where there is no overarching authority, states operate in a self-help environment and compete for power out of self-interest and the motivation for survival**. The lack of a central global authority means states cannot rely on institutions for protection but must provide for their own security. This encourages states to accumulate material capabilities and engage in power politics to shift the balance of power in their favor.

**Neorealists think that power is what matters in world politics.  It depends on the material capabilities that a state can do**.  States fight for power and do everything they can to tip the scales of power in their favor.

Classical realists thought that conflict was built into people, but modern structural realists (neorealist) say that states have to play power politics because of how the international system is set up (i.e. the chaotic order of the international system).

## Core Assumptions

Structural realism is based on five core assumptions about the international system:

- **Great powers are the main actors** and they operate in an **anarchic international system**. By anarchy realists do not mean chaos, but simply the absence of a centralized global authority that can enforce rules on states.
- **All states possess offensive military capabilities**, although this varies over time. States build up military power for offensive and defensive purposes.
- **States can never be certain about other states' intentions**. A defensive military stance by one state can look offensive and threatening to another state. This links to the debate between offensive and defensive realists on whether states aim to revise the status quo or maintain it.
- **The main goal of states is survival**. Their primary motivation is to ensure their continuing existence as sovereign entities.
- **States are rational actors operating with imperfect information** - they aim to make calculated decisions to maximize their interests, but sometimes make mistakes due to limited information.

## Offensive vs Defensive Realism

There is an important debate within structural realism between 'defensive' and 'offensive' camps.

**Offensive realists** argue that states should always be looking for opportunities to gain more power, with the ultimate prize being hegemony, as this is the best means to ensure survival.

**Defensive realists** argue that unrelenting expansion is imprudent as conquest is often costly and troublesome. For this reason, defensive realists believe that states should seek an 'appropriate amount of power' rather than maximum power.

Structural realists also recognize a debate around revisionist states vs status quo states. **Revisionist states** aim to alter the balance of power in their favor, while **status quo states** are satisfied with the current order. This leads to the 'security dilemma' where defensive military postures can appear aggressive to other states.

## Bipolarity vs Multipolarity

Structural realists have an important debate on whether a bipolar system (two great powers) or a multipolar system (three or more great powers) is more stable in international relations.

### Bipolarity More Stable?

Realists who believe bipolarity leads to greater stability offer three main arguments:

1. There are fewer opportunities for great powers to fight each other compared to a multipolar system. With only two major powers, the possibilities for conflict are more limited.
2. The relative balance of power between the two superpowers tends to be more even in terms of wealth, population, and other resources that build military might. This makes balancing behaviors between the two easier and more stable.
3. There is greater potential for miscalculation and mistrust in a multipolar system with more great powers. The dynamics between two powers are simpler to understand and anticipate.

### Multipolarity More Stable?

Realists who argue multipolarity produces more stability provide two key rationales:

1. More great powers create more deterrence. In a multipolar world, multiple states can join together to deter an aggressive power.
2. Attention and hostility is more diffused with more major powers. Rather than intense bipolar competition, realists believe multipolarity leads to less directly confrontational postures between the great powers as they focus on diverse threats.

## Unipolarity

With the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, many realists argue that unipolarity has arrived. Such a world is likely to be more stable than either bipolarity or multipolarity. Logically, there can be no war or security competition among great powers; minor powers will not cause any trouble for fear of offending the unipolar power. One danger in a unipolar world is that the absence of security competition encourages the great power to withdraw from outer regions thus increasing the likelihood of war breaking out. Or a hegemon might use its overwhelming power to engage in ideological engineering, causing insecurity and triggering ideologically driven counter-balancing behavior.

However, other realists argue that it is not polarity that is the key variable explaining war, rather it is the amount of power each great power controls. The question is whether preponderance generates relative peace (such as in the era of Pax Britannica between Napoleon's defeat in 1815 and the outbreak of World War 1), or if it incentivizes the preponderant power to use force to establish hegemony.

## Power Concentration

Another key debate within structural realism focuses on the distribution of power between states (**balance of power**). Specifically, whether relative peace emerges when one state has clear preponderance, or if conflict is more likely when a rising challenger confronts an established power.

On one side, some argue that **preponderance of power** generates stability, as evidenced by the era of _Pax Britannica_ from Napoleon's defeat in 1815 to World War I. When one state has clear military and economic superiority, it can deter challenges through strength alone.

However, others contend that **rising challengers** are the most dangerous dynamic, pointing to Germany confronting Russia in 1914 and the Soviet Union in 1939. As Bismarck consolidated power for Germany, stability prevailed. But when Wilhelmine and Nazi Germany sought rapid expansion, it led directly to devastating wars.

## Case Study: China's Rise

China's rapid economic growth and military modernization has led realists to debate the implications of China's rise for international stability.

- Offensive realists predict that China will pursue regional hegemony in Asia as its power grows. This means removing threats to its security and displacing the United States as the dominant military power in Asia. The United States will resist this challenge to its unipolar power. Conflict is likely according to offensive realists.
- Defensive realists argue China will be deterred from pursuing hegemony by nuclear rivals like India and the high costs of conquest. They predict China will consolidate power but avoid aggressive expansion.

China's rise also has implications for neorealist views on unipolarity and the stability it brings. If China's power shifts the structure to bipolarity, some argue the Cold War showed this can be stable. However, those who see unipolarity as uniquely peaceful will be concerned about China threatening the United States' preponderant power.

In conclusion, neorealists disagree on whether China can rise peacefully. Their diverging views on power balances and causes of war lead to different predictions about China's trajectory. Its actual path will be an important test of neorealist theories.

<exercise id="5" title="Neoliberalism">  


Neoliberalism is a theory in international relations that focuses on the role of international institutions in facilitating cooperation between states. It emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as a response to realism, challenging the view that the anarchic structure of the international system prevents cooperation. 

Neoliberalism makes several key assumptions:

- The international system is anarchical, with no overarching authority above states
- States are rational, self-interested actors
- Cooperation is possible but difficult under anarchy due to concerns over relative gains, cheating, and enforcement
- International institutions help mitigate these issues by providing information, reducing transaction costs, promoting iterated games, and monitoring agreements

Neoliberalism is concerned with studying how institutions can facilitate bargaining between states, prevent defection from agreements, and foster cooperation even in an anarchic global order. It offers a more optimistic view than realism on the prospects for collaboration, but still recognizes that egoism and cheating pose challenges.

## Origins of Neoliberalism

Pluralism literature, which stressed the role of non-state actors in breaking down domestic barriers, is where neoliberalism got its start. This literature called for a more complete view of international affairs.

Neoliberalism, on the other hand, is different because it takes a state-centered view, similar to structural realism. Neoliberalism sees states as rational, unitary actors that try to maximize their own utility. This view is largely based on economic studies that look at rationality and utility-maximization.

For example, Keohane and Nye's "Power and Interdependence" and other important neoliberal works tried to find a balance between optimism and sticking to the realist idea that people are selfish and self-centered.

Neorealists (Grieco, Krasner) and neoliberals (Keohane) debates in the 1980s and 1990s, is called the neo-neo debates. Neoliberals focused on two major changes in the 20th century that made realism less accurate when it came to explaining global politics: the United States' hegemonic stability and the growing interdependence between actors.

This change in how people think shows how pluralism, neorealism, and neoliberalism have changed how people think about international relations over time.

## Barriers to Cooperation

Neoliberalism recognizes that cooperation does not come easily in an anarchic international system comprised of self-interested states. States may be hesitant to cooperate if they fear others will defect or free-ride off their efforts. As such, neoliberalism examines the barriers that hinder international cooperation:

**Anarchy** - The decentralized nature of the international system, with no overarching authority, makes it difficult to enforce compliance. States recognize that any agreements lack an external enforcement mechanism. This absence of hierarchy promotes uncertainty and mistrust between states.

**Defection** - States may hesitate to cooperate if they fear others will fail to uphold their end of an agreement. Without recourse to an external authority, states worry partners may defect from deals that no longer serve their self-interest. This presents an obstacle to mutually beneficial cooperation.

**Free-riding** - States want to ensure their cooperative efforts will not simply benefit free-riders who do not share costs. In an anarchic system, states cannot be certain joint gains will be equitably shared. The possibility of free-riding disincentivizes cooperation.

Neoliberalism examines these challenges presented by anarchy, defection, and free-riding. It then analyzes how international institutions can be designed to facilitate cooperation despite these barriers.

# Role of Institutions

International institutions are crucial for neoliberalism because they help facilitate cooperation between states in an anarchic international system. Neoliberals believe institutions can be rationally designed to mitigate the challenges of cooperation.

Institutions facilitate repeated interactions between states, building trust and allowing them to cooperate over time for mutual benefit. They also provide information to states about each other's behavior and intentions, reducing uncertainty. Moreover, institutions establish rules and norms for appropriate state actions.

Since cooperation is challenging in an anarchic environment, neoliberals have an interest in developing the rational design of international institutions. Their aim is to create institutional structures and mechanisms that promote bargaining between states, deter defection from agreements, and give institutions some autonomy from state control. Careful institutional design can alleviate barriers to cooperation.

## Bargaining

The first broad theme involves the extent to which institutional designs play a role in international negotiations and **bargaining**. In order to reach a collectively agreed decision, states need a degree of regularity in the rules and procedures for their collective decision-making. 

Overall, bargaining is facilitated by regular institutional processes that structure repeated interactions between states. This allows collective decision-making to emerge through compromise and reduced transaction costs.

## Defection 

The second broad category of institutional design problems of interest to neoliberal scholars involves the issue of **defection**. Because states fear that their cooperative partners may fail to live up to mutual agreement, states may be discouraged from engaging in cooperative projects in the first place. They may also be concerned with the ability of other states to free-ride or indirectly (and without incurring costs) benefit from their cooperative efforts. These concern lead to an obvious question: how can international institution be designed to alleviate concerns over defection?

Institution can play a role in alleviating two important aspects of defection that is **compliance** and **enforcement**. Compliance involves the extent to which states can be induced or encouraged to abide by international agreements to which they are parties. Enforcement involves the extent to which states can be forced into compliance and possibly punished for their failure to do so. Institutional mechanism for monitoring state behavior are particularly important for compliance, because such monitoring makes all states aware of one another's behavior's

## Autonomy

Neoliberal scholars are also interested in the third, more general area of institutional design: **autonomy**. Neoliberalism says that international institutions make it easier for people to work together for their own benefit, but it's not always clear that results are caused by institutions alone. The issue is with the neoliberal idea that international organizations are made so that people can benefit from them. Is it possible for international institutions to be looked at separately from the interests of their member states?

## Case Study - WTO

The World Trade Organization (WTO) serves as a forum of free trade organizations and agreements, for states to negotiate free trade agreements and settle trade disputes. It rests on the presumption that it is normatively valuable and – along the stag hunt analogy – rationally beneficial to participate in the global activity of capitalist free trade. 

WTO's institutional design developed out of the collective experience with GATT. Established in 1948, out of Anglo-American hegemonic vision of a new global economic order during the Second World War, it finally crumbled under its inability to coordinate trade liberalization, given the different domestic pressures on states towards protectionism. Rounds of negotiations within the GATT framework led to the establishment of the WTO in 1995.

WTO is a formal inter-governmental organization with a full Secretariat and an extensive institutional structure to cover all aspects of trade. Despite collective will, WTO has faced heavy critiques as a decentralized, undemocratic institution that represents corporate interests with clear North-South divisions. Nonetheless, it demonstrates the importance of institutional design to **collective goals** in an otherwise anarchic environment.

## Conclusion

International co-operation is now an embedded, enduring feature of global politics. States cooperate on issues ranging from trade and economics to security and the environment. This cooperation takes place through formal institutions like the United Nations and World Trade Organization, as well as through ad hoc multilateral agreements and regional organizations. 

While cooperation does not always run smoothly, it has become a standard practice for states pursuing their interests in the international system. Conflict and competition still occur, but so too does collaboration. Even rivals cooperate in certain domains.

Neoliberalism seeks to understand how this cooperation is initiated and maintained. Its theories examine the role of institutions, regimes, and norms in facilitating bargaining, mitigating defection, and fostering complex interdependence between actors. Neoliberals recognize that cooperation faces many obstacles in an anarchic environment. But they maintain it is both normatively valuable and rationally beneficial for states to participate in global governance through institutions.

The study of how institutions support cooperation - while imperfect - provides insight into building a more stable international order. Neoliberalism accepts the problems and conflicts inherent to global politics. Yet it ultimately asserts cooperation is achievable if institutional designs evolve to promote state interests. Anarchy did not mean the end of collaboration.

<exercise id="6" title="Dependency Theory">  


Dependency theory emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a critique of modernization theory and as a way to explain persistent underdevelopment in Latin America and other developing regions. 

The theory arose in response to concerns that economic growth in the advanced industrialized countries did not necessarily lead to growth in the poorer countries. Dependency theorists argued that poverty in developing countries was not because they were "backward" or lacked the necessary cultural values for development, as modernization theorists claimed.

Instead, dependency theorists focused on the problem of exploitation of peripheral and semi-peripheral countries by the wealthy core countries. They suggested that Western colonization and economic dominance created a dependence that led to long-lasting patterns of poverty. 

<br>

<center> <img src="modules\world systen.png" alt="Worldwide Web" width="80%" /> </center>

<br>

Dependency theory also challenged the prevailing approach of the post-World War II era that advocated "**development through industrialization**." In contrast, dependency theorists believed that countries needed to focus on internal factors first rather than uncritically copying industrial policies from advanced capitalist countries.

Overall, dependency theory opened up a new perspective focusing on the realities of underdevelopment in the Third World. It emphasized the influence of external forces on local economies and the historical causes of global inequality between the so-called developed and developing nations.

## Key Assumptions of Dependency Theory

Dependency theory seeks to explain underdevelopment and global inequality by emphasizing the influence of external factors on Third World countries. The theory is an alternative approach to the modernization theory, which focuses primarily on internal factors as causes of underdevelopment. 

The key assumptions of dependency theory include:

### Emphasis on External Factors

- Dependency theory focuses on the role of external political, economic, social, and cultural forces in inhibiting development in poor countries. It suggests that poverty in developing countries has historical origins in colonization and unequal economic relationships with western capitalist countries.

### Center-Periphery Structure

- The theory argues that the global capitalist economy is divided between industrialized, developed "center" countries and underdeveloped "peripheral" countries. The center exploits the periphery through unequal trade, terms of trade, and resource extraction.

### Unequal Exchange 

- Underdevelopment is perpetuated through the unequal exchange of raw materials and low-wage labor from the periphery for high-value manufactured goods from the center. This systematically drains wealth from poor countries.

### Dependency, not Dependence

- The condition of underdevelopment is not a natural state of dependence on external support. Rather, it stems from complex historical conditions and structural relationships that limit development. Dependency is an active condition reinforced by global capitalism.

In summary, dependency theory stresses external determinants in creating poverty and underdevelopment, in contrast to modernization theory's emphasis on internal factors within poor countries themselves.

## Historical Context

Dependency theory came about in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when countries were being freed from colonial rule and the gap between rich and poor countries was getting bigger. 

In the years after World War II, many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America got rid of their colonial regimes and became independent. But even though they had political independence, these new countries were still economically inferior and not developing enough. The industrialized capitalist countries in North America and Western Europe ran the world economy. 

The former colonies, on the other hand, continued to depend on exporting raw materials and primary goods. Their economies were set up to meet the needs of the more developed industrial economies, not to help their own growth.

The gap between the rich countries in the global North and the poor countries in the global South grew because of this unequal relationship. People thought that moving technology and money from the center to the edges would help development, but the former colonies stayed poor. 

Dependency theorists said that global inequality and underdevelopment in the periphery were caused by outside and historical factors. They disagreed with the idea of modernization, which said that all societies develop in the same way. Instead, they stressed that global capitalism and relying on other countries meant that poor countries had to give wealthy countries natural resources, cheap labor, and markets.

## Impact of Colonialism on Developing Countries

Dependency theory explains the impact of colonialism on developing countries by highlighting the role of external factors in the underdevelopment of Third World countries. The theory says that the world is split into a center of wealthy industrialized countries and a periphery of poor, underdeveloped countries. Because of this structural division, underdevelopment stays the same. Colonialism had a big impact on this center-periphery structure and made it worse for peripheral countries to not develop as much.

Some important points from dependency theory about how colonialism affected developing countries are:

1. **Extraction of surplus**: Colonial powers took extra from the colonies, which held these countries back from developing fully. Colonial countries often took advantage of the colonies' natural resources and cheap labor, while the colonies' resources and labor helped their own countries.
2. **Unequal exchange**: The trade between the center and the periphery was unfair because it mixed goods that made a lot of money but didn't cost much with goods that did. This unfair trade made it harder for peripheral countries to develop.
3. **Cultural and social impact**: As the countries that colonized others tried to force their values, beliefs, and ways of life on the colonies, colonization also had effects on the colonies' culture and society. This forcing of foreign cultural and social elements on these countries could make their lack of progress even worse.
4. **Persistence of underdevelopment**: The center-periphery structure that colonialism created and the unequal trade between countries afterward made it so that underdevelopment didn't go away in the peripheral countries. As these countries tried to grow, they were often slowed down by unfair trade terms and the cultural and social effects of colonialism.

Overall, dependency theory says that colonialism was a big reason why developing countries were not developing enough. It did this by setting up a center-periphery structure and encouraging unfair trade between countries. As the peripheral countries tried to recover from the bad effects of colonialism, this caused them to remain underdeveloped.

## Types of Dependency Theory

The types of dependency theory can be classified into three categories: **the ECLA School, the Moderates, and the Radicals**. This classification is based on the different views of dependency and strategies to overcome dependency. 
- The ECLA (Economic Commission for Latin America) School, associated with the work of Raul Prebisch, emphasizes the structural constraints of the international economic system on the development of peripheral countries. 
- The Moderates, including scholars like Fernando Henrique Cardoso, focus on the internal and external factors that contribute to dependency and underdevelopment. 
- The Radicals, such as Andre Gunder Frank, emphasize the revolutionary transformation of the global economic system to overcome dependency. These categories represent the diverse analytical approaches and strategies within dependency theory.

## Dependency Theory and Karl Marx

Dependency theory and Karl Marx both spoke out against capitalism and the way workers are exploited in some similar ways. Dependency theory focuses on how outside factors cause Third World countries to be underdeveloped, while Marx's theory is more concerned with how workers are exploited in capitalist societies. 

In both theories, it is said that the majority of people lose out when a small group of elites get more money and power. There are, however, some differences between the two ideas. 

**Dependency theory focuses on outside factors**, like the global economy's center-periphery structure, **while Marx's theory looks at how capitalism is flawed from the inside**. Marx's theory also stresses the significance of class struggle and the possibility of revolutionary change. Dependency theory, on the other hand, focuses on the structural barriers that make it hard for peripheral countries to grow. **There are some similarities between Karl Marx's theory and dependency theory, but there are also big differences in how they look at global inequality and the change that could happen in society**.

Dependency theory and Karl Marx's theory of imperialism are related in a number of ways. Both try to explain why countries, especially those in the Global South, are exploited and underdeveloped. Here are some important links between the two theories:

1. The exploitation of labor: Both theories stress that the exploitation of labor is a key part of capitalist systems. Marx's theory of imperialism looks at how labor is exploited in capitalist societies, while dependency theory looks at how labor is exploited in developing countries.
2. The part of capitalist growth: Both theories say that as capitalist societies grow, they take advantage of other countries and keep them from developing. Dependency theory says that Third World countries become less developed when advanced capitalist countries grow. On the other hand, Marx's theory of imperialism says that when capitalist markets and investments grow, they can take advantage of these countries' labor and resources.
3. Effects on inequality around the world: Both theories say that the capitalist system makes and keeps inequality around the world. Dependency theory says that the global economy's structure of a center and a periphery keeps peripheral countries from developing, while Marx's theory of imperialism says that the uneven growth of capitalist markets and investments can cause these countries' labor and resources to be exploited.
4. The role of class struggle: Marx's theory of imperialism stresses how important class struggle is and how it can lead to revolutionary change. Dependency theory, on the other hand, doesn't stress class struggle as much. Instead, it looks at the structural problems that make it hard for peripheral countries to develop.

To sum up, Karl Marx's theory of imperialism and dependency theory are both concerned with how labor is exploited and how capitalist expansion leads to inequality around the world. There are, however, some differences between the two theories. For example, one focuses on class struggle, while the other on the structural problems that make it hard for peripheral countries to grow.

## Criticisms of Dependency Theory

Dependency theory has some critics who say it oversimplifies the reasons why Third World countries aren't developing enough and doesn't give a clear explanation for where underdevelopment comes from. Here are some of the main complaints:

1. Focusing too much on outside factors: Some people say that dependency theory ignores the importance of internal factors in explaining underdevelopment and instead puts too much weight on outside factors like the international system.
2. Circular reasoning: Dependency theory's explanation of the link between underdevelopment and dependency can lead to circular reasoning because it says that dependency leads to underdevelopment, which in turn leads to dependency.
3. Ignoring internal factors: People who disagree with dependency theory say that it doesn't look at the internal factors that lead to underdevelopment, like the way the state is set up, social classes, and cultural practices.
4. Not paying enough attention to class struggle: Dependency theory is criticized for not highlighting the importance of class struggle and the chance for revolutionary change, which is a key part of Marxist ideas.
5. Different ideas about dependency: Researchers working on the theory of dependency use different ways to look at things, put more or less emphasis on different things, and come up with different ways to get over dependency. This wide range of opinions can make it hard to understand how to use dependency theory correctly.

Even with these problems, dependency theory has given us new ways to look at the real world of international political economy. It has also helped us understand why some Third World countries aren't developing as much as they could, and it has raised the question of who is responsible for that.

<exercise id="7" title="Constructivism">  

Constructivism in International Relations emerged from a critique of the more traditional IR theories during the Cold War period. Constructivists rejected the static material assumptions that dominated traditional IR theories and instead emphasized the social dimensions of IR and the possibility for change. **They argued that international relations are socially constructed rather than existing independently**. This means that phenomena such as states, alliances, or international institutions do not inherently exist on their own but rather come into being through human meaning and action. The central themes of change, social interactions, and ongoing processes pointed to the value of a constructivist perspective within a field that had previously focused on generalization across time, material factors, and rational choice assumptions. 

The term "constructivism" was introduced to IR by Nicholas Onuf in 1989 to refer broadly to postpositivist perspectives which shared a skepticism of the static assumptions in mainstream IR theories. However, over time scholars began distinguishing between "conventional" constructivism and more critical variations like poststructuralism.

Moreover, constructivists reject the assumptions of egoism and instrumentalism. **They claim that international actors are committed in their decisions to values and norms and choose the appropriate instead of the efficient behavioral option**. On the basis of these assumptions, constructivists analyze international institutions not merely as regulatory institutions that constrain the behavioral options available to actors and influence their cost-benefit assessments. Constructivism posits that the origins and the constitution as well as the goals and the procedures of international organizations are more strongly determined by the standards of legitimacy and appropriateness of the international community they represent than by the utilitarian demand for efficient problem-solving

## Core Ideas 

Constructivism is based on the notion that international relations are socially constructed. This means that phenomena such as states, alliances, or international institutions do not exist independently of human meaning and action. Rather, these are constructs that only come into being through social acts and shared understandings. 

Some key themes and assumptions of constructivism include:

- **Socially constructed reality** - The international system and its components do not have inherent properties, but gain meaning through social interaction and interpretation. Constructivists emphasize the importance of social context and intersubjective knowledge.
- **Change** - Unlike rationalist theories which emphasize continuity, constructivists see change as possible through new ways of social interaction and meaning making. International relations are not fixed structures but ongoing dynamic processes.
- **Sociality** - Humans are fundamentally social beings, and individual identities and interests are shaped by cultural and institutional contexts, not pre-existing. Therefore, understanding social dimensions is key.
- **Processes** - Constructivists focus on the processes through which structures constitute agents and vice versa, rather than just structures or just agents. Ongoing interaction and mutual constitution between agents and structures are central.

## Origins

Constructivism in International Relations emerged in the late 1980s as a critique of the dominant theories in the field at the time. The term "constructivism" was introduced by scholar Nicholas Onuf in his 1989 book, World of Our Making, to refer broadly to a range of postpositivist perspectives united by their rejection of the static assumptions of realist and liberal theories. 

Onuf and other early constructivists argued that mainstream IR theories like realism and liberalism treated the international system as fixed and immutable. They assumed that the nature of international relations was determined by the rational, material interests of states or individuals. Constructivists challenged these positivist perspectives by emphasizing that the subjects and structures of international relations are socially constructed, not objectively given.

The constructivist critique maintained that phenomena like states, alliances, threats, institutions, and identities do not have any inherent meaning outside of human interpretation. Their meaning is constructed through social interaction and can change over time as norms, ideas, language, and culture evolve. This contrasted with mainstream theories that treated these elements of world politics as static objects that could be studied empirically.

By introducing ideas about social construction from sociology and philosophy into IR theory, early constructivists like Onuf opened up new possibilities for understanding how the international system is shaped by intersubjective factors like beliefs, shared knowledge, language, and socialization. This established constructivism as a leading alternative to rationalist theories grounded in materialism and individualism.

## Types

Constructivism refers broadly to a range of postpositivist perspectives in IR theory which share a critique of the static assumptions of mainstream IR approaches. However, scholars have made a distinction between 'conventional' constructivism and more critical variations, including poststructuralism.

### Conventional Constructivism

Conventional constructivism is said to occupy the middle ground between rationalism and poststructuralism in IR theory. By adopting a positivist epistemology, conventional constructivists have gained considerable legitimacy within the discipline. As a result, their debate with rationalists has come to occupy an important place in IR theory. 

Conventional constructivism adds a social dimension that is missing from rationalist approaches. What is considered rational is seen as a function of legitimacy, defined by shared values and norms within institutions or other social structures, rather than purely individual interests.

### Critical Constructivism 

Critical constructivists have questioned the individualist ontology of rationalism and instead emphasize a social ontology. As fundamentally social beings, individuals or states cannot be separated from the context of normative meaning which shapes their identities and possibilities. 

Critical perspectives also focus on how structures not only constrain actors, but also constitute their identities. The individual or state can influence their environment as well as being influenced by it, through a process of interaction and mutual constitution.

## Critical Constructivism

Critical constructivists have questioned the individualist ontology of rationalism and instead emphasize a social ontology. As fundamentally social beings, individuals or states cannot be separated from a context of normative meaning which shapes who they are and the possibilities available to them. 

Structures not only constrain actors they also constitute identities. The individual or state can also influence their environment as well as being influenced by it, through a process of interaction and mutual constitution.

## Structures and Agents

Constructivism emphasizes that structures not only constrain actors, they also constitute identities. The individual or state can also influence their environment as well as being influenced by it, through a process of interaction and mutual constitution. 

Structures like states, alliances or international institutions are not thought to exist independent of human meaning and action. Rather, these structures shape the identities and possibilities available to the agents that inhabit them. For example, the structure of the United Nations constitutes the identity of a country as a member state, which confers certain rights and responsibilities. 

At the same time, agents like states and individuals are not completely determined by structure. They have agency to influence and change the environment that shapes them through a process of mutual interaction. States can cooperate to reform international institutions, or an individual can advocate for policy changes in their country. Both structure and agency are important for understanding how the social world is constructed.

The emphasis on mutual constitution of structures and agents moves away from traditional IR theories that treat structures as static constraints and focuses instead on the complex interplay between the two. This dialectic relationship is key to the constructivist view that international relations are not fixed, but are socially constructed and thus contain possibility for change driven by social interaction.

## Case Study : NATO Enlargement

The constructivist view of NATO enlargement as international socialization is based on the idea that countries learn the values and norms of the community and change how they do things in their own countries and in international relations as a result. Compared to rationalist views like neorealism and neoliberalism, which have trouble explaining why international organizations like NATO keep growing, this view gives a more complete picture of why NATO has grown.

The constructivist explanation addresses three main questions:

1. Why do central and eastern European (CEE) countries strive to become NATO members?
2. Why did NATO decide to expand to the east?
3. Why were only the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland invited to become NATO members?

The constructivist response to these questions is as follows:

1. CEE countries have tried to find a new identity and a new "home" in the international system since the fall of the communist system in their own countries and around the world. It has become their main foreign policy goal to "return to Europe," with joining NATO being a big part of that. Not having to agree with all of the Western world's rules and values is not a requirement for the Central and Eastern European countries to want to join NATO

2. NATO chose to grow to the east to support and strengthen democracy, liberal values, and multilateralism in the area. CEE countries want to join NATO, which encourages them to continue working on democratic reform and making their own systems more like those in other countries. They also want to handle international conflicts in this area peacefully, through multilateralism, and according to international law.

3. The Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland were invited to join NATO because they shared the liberal values of the Western world, had internalized its core values well enough, and had behaved in line with those values for a certain amount of time. The constructivist hypothesis says that these countries' membership in NATO gave them a reason to keep working on democratic reform and solidify the changes they were already making to their own systems.

To sum up, the constructivist view of NATO expansion as international socialization is based on the idea that countries **adopt community values and norms**, which causes them to change how they handle their own domestic and foreign policies. When compared to rationalist views, this one gives a more complete explanation for NATO's growth.

<exercise id="8" title="Domestic Politics: Two Level Games">  

# What is two-level game?

The "two-level game" is a theoretical approach about how state's representative in negotiations between states shape their state's foreign policy by two stages, that is:

1) bargaining between **international** negotiators , leading to a tentative agreement (Level I)
2) separate discussions within each **domestic or national** group of constituents about whether to ratify the agreement (Level II). 

The win-set refers to the set of all possible Level I agreements that would gain the necessary majority among the constituents when simply voted up or down. It is important for understanding the likelihood of reaching an agreement and the distribution of joint gains from the international bargain. 

The size of the "win-set" of feasible agreements depends on the distribution of power, preferences, and possible coalitions among Level II constituents. The two-level game is a complex process in which moves that are rational for a player at one level may be impolitic for that same player at the other level. The requirement that any Level I agreement must be ratified at Level II imposes a crucial theoretical link between the two levels.

# Process of Two-Level Game

The two-level game process, as proposed by Robert D. Putnam, involves two stages: Level I and Level II. 

- **Level I**: This stage entails bargaining between negotiators from different states, leading to a tentative mutual agreement. The actors' in this level is: parties leader, ministry, etc.  

- **Level II**: In this stage, separate discussions occur within each group of constituents about whether to ratify the agreement reached at Level I. The actors' in this level is between negotiator and domestic actors (legislative members', interest group, etc)

The process is sequential, with the requirement that any Level I agreement must be ratified at Level II, thereby creating a crucial theoretical link between the two levels. The size of the "win-set," which refers to the set of all possible Level I agreements that would gain the necessary majority among the constituents when simply voted up or down, is a key determinant of the possibility of reaching an agreement. The win-set depends on the distribution of power, preferences, and possible coalitions among Level II constituents, and it affects the likelihood of reaching an agreement and the distribution of joint gains from the international bargain.

<br>

# Win-Sets Determinant

The concept of "win-set" in the two-level games theory is a crucial determinant of the possibility of reaching an agreement in international negotiations. The win-set refers to the set of all possible Level I agreements that would gain the necessary majority among the constituents when simply voted up or down. It is influenced by several factors, including:

1. **Distribution of power and preferences**: The size of the win-set depends on the distribution of power, preferences, and possible coalitions among Level 1 constituents.
2. **Domestic political constraints**: The preferences and power of domestic actors, such as interest groups, political parties, bureaucrats, and the general public, can affect the size of the win-set.
3. **Overlap of win-sets**: The likelihood of reaching an agreement is increased if the win-sets of the negotiating parties overlap, meaning that there is some common ground on which they can agree. Conversely, if the win-sets do not overlap, the negotiations are more likely to break down.

# What if state's failed to ratify the agreement?

The ratification process does not guarantee the implementation of state agreements. The state has full authority to comply or disobey the agreement. There are 2 types of rejection:

**Voluntary Defection (based on state egoism)**

Voluntary defection in game theory refers to reneging by a **rational egoist** in the absence of enforceable contracts, as seen in the prisoner's dilemma and other dilemmas of collective action.
The reason for this rejection makes the situation "the absence of hierarchy" a justification for all egoist state actions. For example: the US decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol seems legitimate even though environmental damage is getting worse due to industrialization.

**Involuntary Defection (the state's inability to fulfill the agreement)**

Involuntary defection refers to the behavior of an agent (states) who is unable to deliver on a promise because of failed ratification.

<exercise id="9" title="Feminism">  


Feminist theories entered the discipline of International Relations (IR) in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a critique of the mainstream theories, which largely excluded gender as a category of analysis. Feminists argued that gender hierarchies are inherent in the international system, and that only by examining them can we fully understand global politics. They emphasized that most IR knowledge has been created by and focused on men, rendering women invisible. As such, feminists have advocated for analyzing how individuals, especially marginalized people, are impacted by and impact global politics. 

Feminist perspectives in IR are diverse, but share a commitment to gender equality and emancipation. They have illuminated issues like security, conflict, development, and the global economy through a gendered lens. This article will provide an overview of the main feminist approaches in IR theory, their perspectives on gender and security, and an application of feminist analysis to economic sanctions in Iraq. The goal is to demonstrate how feminism deepens our understanding of global politics.

## Liberal Feminism

Liberal feminism calls attention to the subordinate position of women in global politics but remains committed to investigating the causes of this subordination within a positivist framework. This perspective pushes for legal reforms as the path to achieving women's equality, granting women the same rights and opportunities as men in society.  

Methodologically, liberal feminism often uses gender as a statistical inquiry. For example, some argue that greater gender equality within states makes them less prone to violence compared to other states. The liberal feminist perspective stays committed to institutional approaches, believing legal reforms provide the best chance to eliminate gender disparities. In this view, the law should not discriminate based on gender.

Overall, liberal feminism aligns with core tenets of liberalism - a focus on individual legal rights, incremental institutional change through policy, and social progress guided by empirical research. While not revolutionary, liberal feminists believe working within existing power structures provides the most pragmatic strategy for empowering women and moving towards equality under the law.

## Critical Feminism

Critical feminism explores the ideational and material manifestations of gendered identities and gendered power in global politics. 

Critical feminists take an emancipatory approach and are committed to trying to understand the world in order to try to change it. As Sandra Whitworth (1994) suggests gender is constituted not just by material conditions but also by the meaning given to that reality _ideas_ that men and women have about their relationships to one another.

Critical feminists analyze both the material and ideational factors that contribute to gendered power dynamics in global politics. On the material side, they examine how gender roles, relations, and identities are shaped by political, economic, and social institutions and systems. At the same time, critical feminists also explore how ideas about gender influence global politics and vice versa. 

With an emancipatory approach, the goal of critical feminism is not just explanation and understanding, but using knowledge to facilitate progressive change. Critical feminists aim to reveal gender biases and inequalities in global politics as a step toward transforming unjust gender relations and empowering disadvantaged groups. Through praxis, or the integration of theory and practice, critical feminists combine scholarly analysis with political activism and advocacy.

Overall, critical feminism provides a multifaceted analysis of gender and global politics that engages with both material realities and social constructions. This enables a deeper understanding of gender subordination and offers pathways toward more equitable gender relations in the international system.

## Constructivist Feminism 

Constructivist feminism focuses on the way ideas about gender influence global politics as well as the ways that global politics shape ideas about gender. Constructivists examine the role of norms, ideas, cultures and identities in shaping gender roles and relations. 

From a linguistically based feminist constructivist perspective, Elisabeth Prugl argues that gender politics pervade world politics, creating a set of linguistically-based rules about how states interact with each other and with their own citizens. For example, nation states and the language of nationalism have tended to portray the nation as a 'family' with the head of state as the 'father' who must protect the 'motherland'. This shapes certain expectations about masculinity and femininity in global politics.

Linguistic analysis also reveals how states assert their power and justify their actions using gendered language. For instance, powerful states have justified colonialism, war and intervention by framing themselves as the protector or civilizer, taking on a masculine role, while framing the recipient state with feminine qualities of weakness, irrationality or innocence. 

Constructivists examine how these gendered ideas and discourses are created, shared, internalized and transformed through global political processes and interactions. This shapes identities, interests and distributions of power between men and women globally.

## Poststructural Feminism 

Poststructuralist feminism is concerned with the relationship between knowledge and power; those who construct meaning and create knowledge thereby gain a great deal of power. They seek to expose and deconstruct the hierarchies found in dichotomized linguistic constructions such as civilized/uncivilized, order/anarchy, and developed/underdeveloped. 

Poststructural feminists focus on analyzing texts and their meaning in order to reveal the underlying power structures. They argue that mainstream IR theory reinforces male dominance by framing world politics in terms of masculinized concepts like anarchy, conflict, and power politics. By deconstructing such binary oppositions, poststructural feminists aim to show how gendered assumptions and norms permeate global politics.

According to poststructural feminists, language does not simply reflect reality - it actively shapes and constructs it. They are concerned with how certain groups are marginalized or subordinated through discourse. For example, the dichotomy between developed and underdeveloped states justifies and perpetuates global inequalities and obscures the complex relations of interdependence.  

By exposing and challenging masculine biases in IR theory and international practices, poststructural feminists seek to transform the field into one that promotes gender justice and equality. Their focus on discourse, knowledge, and power provides important insights into the gendered nature of global politics.

## Postcolonial Feminism

Postcolonial feminism focuses on the way Western feminists have constructed knowledge about non-Western women. Postcolonial feminists aim to redress subordinations within their own cultural context, rather than through some universal understanding of women's needs promoted by Western feminism. 

Postcolonial feminists critique the assumption held by some Western feminists that their view of women's rights should apply universally. They argue that Western feminist discourse ignores cultural differences and imposes Western ideals upon non-Western cultures. Postcolonial feminists emphasize that women face differing forms of patriarchy across cultures, and solutions for women's empowerment must arise from within each unique cultural context.

For example, postcolonial feminists have criticized campaigns against female genital mutilation led by Western feminists. They argue these campaigns portray African women as passive victims of barbaric traditions, failing to account for the cultural meaning behind such practices. Postcolonial feminists call for African women to lead reform efforts arising from their own cultural values and realities. 

Overall, postcolonial feminists aim to avoid paternalistic assumptions that developing countries must follow the same feminist path as the West. They advocate for locally-grounded women's movements tailored to each culture's distinct traditions and social norms. Postcolonial feminism asserts that Western feminism should not dominate global discourse on women's rights.

## Gender, security, and global politics 

Feminists emphasize the significance of gender as a crucial analytical category in understanding security and insecurity. In the realm of International Relations (IR), feminists adopt a comprehensive approach to security, encompassing various forms of violence such as physical, structural, and ecological issues. This perspective includes not only traditional security threats like war but also addresses domestic violence, gender subordination, poverty, and ecological destruction.

Expanding the focus beyond traditional notions of state security, IR feminists redirect attention to the individual and community levels. They reveal the intricate connections between individual security, national and international politics, showcasing how state security policies can potentially render marginalized groups even more insecure. This shift in perspective challenges conventional notions of security and highlights the complex interplay between global politics and individual well-being.

The cultural construction of war often presents it as a means for men to protect vulnerable populations, predominantly defined as women and children. Paradoxically, recent wars have shown that women and children constitute a majority of casualties. This dissonance between cultural narratives and actual consequences underscores the need for a feminist lens in reevaluating the legitimacy and impact of war on different demographics.

Contrary to viewing military power solely as a defense against external threats, feminists argue that militaries can pose threats to individuals' security, particularly for women. Moreover, these military forces often compete for scarce resources, disproportionately affecting women who may rely more on these resources than men. This perspective challenges the traditional understanding of militaries as protectors and highlights their potential role as sources of insecurity.

Feminists draw attention to wartime rape as a deliberate military strategy, exemplified by incidents during the war in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. This grim reality underscores the need to analyze conflicts through a gendered lens, revealing the strategic use of violence against women as a tool of war. Such insights reshape our understanding of conflict dynamics and emphasize the urgency of addressing gender-specific security concerns.

## Economic Security 

Gendered economic inequalities and expectation lead to heightened economic insecurity for women globally. Women consistently rank below men in income, employment opportunities, and access to resources across all societies. This economic deprivation cannot be explained by market forces alone - cultural values and gendered social structures play a significant role. 

Women are frequently relegated and confined to low-paying jobs centered around domestic work, childcare, cooking, and cleaning. The expectation that women perform unpaid reproductive labor in the home limits their ability to pursue more lucrative careers. Even in professional fields, women are passed over for promotions and leadership roles. As a result, women disproportionately make up the ranks of the poor worldwide. 

Lack of economic security creates a precarious situation for women. Without financial independence, they become vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Poverty restricts their access to education, healthcare, and political influence. During times of conflict and crisis, women suffer more intensely from shortages of food, medicine, and shelter. 

Achieving gender equality requires dismantling the social and cultural norms that confine women. Legal reforms granting equal rights provide a foundation, but do not address the underlying gender roles. Society must move beyond the mindset that women's work holds less merit and value. When the unpaid labor women perform in the household is recognized as vital economic production, perceptions may shift. Ultimately, women's economic security strengthens families, communities, and nations.

## Case Study: Iraq Sanctions 

The feminist notion of security provides insight into understanding the impact of economic sanctions on Iraq.

### Exclusion of Women's Voices

Feminists critique the sanctions regime on Iraq for systematically excluding women's input into policies that disproportionately affected their lives.  State and global security decisions often undermine women's personal security without considering their perspectives or needs.  

### Gendered Logic of Sanctions  

Feminists see economic sanctions as an expression of masculine confrontation - a competition of power where strong states coerce weaker ones into submission. Such coercive policies frequently impact marginalized groups, like women, the most harshly. From a postcolonial feminist view, the sanctions also assumed Western states inherently understood what was best for Iraqis.  

### State Responsibility 

Feminists question norms of state responsibility and borders that distance nations from the human impact of their policies. Borders construct artificial separations between "self" and "other," enabling countries to separate themselves from accountability.  Feminists encourage reflecting on global hierarchies and recalibrating responsibility for international policies that cause real individual suffering.

<exercise id="10" title="Rational Choice Theory ">  


Rational choice is a major approach in the study of international relations (IR) that has shaped current theoretical debates and enhanced our understanding of topics like anarchy and cooperation. The methodology of rational choice explains individual and collective outcomes by considering the goals individuals pursue within certain constraints. 

While it is not a specific theory, rational choice assumes that actors are rational and make choices based on their preferences and available information. This approach highlights the significance of individual actors and their interests, and has been applied to various aspects of international relations, including cooperation, conflict, and institution-building. 

Although rational choice is often associated with the use of mathematical models, it is not always necessary, as many applications can be described as "soft" without strict ties to formal models. Rational choice is compatible with different approaches and should not be limited by its association with specific substantive positions in international relations, such as realism, neorealism, and neoliberalism.

# Assumption of Rational Choice

The assumption of rational choice is that **actors are rational and make choices based on their preferences and the available information**. Rational choice emphasizes the importance of individual actors and their interests, and it assumes that **actors are utility-maximizers who make decisions based on a cost-benefit analysis**. However, rational choice has faced several challenges, both internal and external, including overemphasis on mathematical technique, lack of strong empirical legs, emphasis on certain problems and neglect of others, and difficulty in explaining key actors, interests, institutions, and change. Despite these challenges, rational choice can improve by taking them seriously and selectively modifying itself in response.

# Utility-Maximizing Theory

Utility-maximizing theory is a central concept in rational choice, which assumes that **actors in international relations (IR) make decisions based on their preferences and the available information**. The theory emphasizes the importance of individual actors and their interests, and it has been applied to various aspects of IR, such as cooperation, conflict, and institution-building. However, the application of utility-maximizing theory in IR has faced several challenges, including the need for more dynamic and process-oriented approaches, as well as the incorporation of non-rational factors in decision-making.

Some key points related to utility-maximizing theory in IR include:

1. **Rational choice and its relation to constructivism**: Rational choice has been criticized for focusing on certain problems and neglecting others, as well as for its difficulty in explaining key actors, interests, institutions, and change.
2. **Fixed and changing preferences**: Rational choice has traditionally assumed that actors and interests are fixed in any analysis and explained change in terms of changing constraints. However, this assumption has been questioned, and the need for a more nuanced approach to preferences has been recognized.
3. **Dynamic and process-oriented approaches**: Rational choice has been criticized for focusing on equilibrium analysis, which does not address the process and mechanisms of change. Some scholars have proposed more dynamic approaches, such as power-transition theory and the Rational Design project, to better understand change in international politics.
4. **Institutions and cooperation**: Rational choice has been applied to the study of institutions and cooperation in international relations, with a focus on how institutions can facilitate the attainment of cooperative equilibria and reinforce and stabilize those equilibria over time.

Despite these challenges, utility-maximizing theory remains an important framework in the study of international relations, with potential for further development and application in understanding the dynamics of actor behavior and decision-making in this field.

## Decision-making process by Rational Choice theory

Here are the steps of decision-making in international relations, as explained by rational choice theory:

1. Actors have preferences and goals that they seek to achieve.
2. Actors gather information about the available options and the potential outcomes of each option.
3. Actors weigh the costs and benefits of each option based on their preferences and the available information.
4. Actors choose the option that maximizes their utility, or the satisfaction they derive from achieving their goals.
5. Actors take action based on their chosen option.

These steps assume that actors are rational and make decisions based on a cost-benefit analysis. 

# Critique of Rational Choice Theory

Rational choice theory has faced several critiques, both internal and external, which challenge its assumptions and limitations. Some of the critiques of rational choice theory are:

- **Overemphasis on mathematical technique**: Rational choice theory has been criticized for developing a fetishism over mathematical technique, which leads to the substitution of abstract and complicated models for commonsensical theoretical development. This has led to the use of obfuscation to hide its emptiness, and explanations not cast in the language of rational choice have not been appreciated.

- **Lack of strong empirical legs**: Rational choice theory has been criticized for not testing its hypotheses adequately, and when it has, it has found little support. Instead of remedying this deficiency, proponents have retreated to theoretical speculations that are increasingly irrelevant.

- **Neglect of certain problems**: Rational choice theory has been criticized for emphasizing certain problems and setting aside other issues by assumption, leading some to doubt the value of rational choice contributions altogether.

- **Difficulty in explaining key actors, interests, institutions, and change**: Rational choice theory has been found deficient in explaining who the key actors are, what their interests are, the origin of institutions, and how these change.

Despite these critiques, rational choice theory remains a powerful and flexible approach that can address the problems of change, preferences, and actor identities within the framework of rational choice.

<exercise id="11" title="Game Theory">  

# What is Game Theory?

Game theory is a social science approach used to **analyze the interactions between individuals or groups in strategic situations, particularly in the context of cooperation and conflict**. It is a rational and structural approach that seeks to understand the choices and strategies of actors in a given situation. 

Game theory models are often used to analyze the dynamics of cooperation and conflict between states, where each state has two choices: cooperate or defect from the other. **The approach is based on the assumption that actors are rational and self-interested, and seeks to identify the optimal strategies for achieving their goals**. The intersection of realism and game theory has been used to analyze the challenges and possibilities of cooperation in international politics, particularly in the context of anarchical systems and the security dilemma.

# Concept From Game Theory

- Cooperation and defection
- Defensive and offensive
- The nature of power
- Perceptions, values, and self-interest
- Psychological impediments to cooperation

# Prisoner's Dilemma

The Prisoner's Dilemma is a concept in game theory that **illustrates a situation in which two rational individuals might not cooperate**, even if it is in their best interest to do so. 

For example, imagine in this dilemma, two suspects are arrested and held in separate cells, and the authorities lack the evidence to convict them on a major charge. They offer each prisoner a deal to testify against the other: 

1. **If one testifies and the other remains silent**, the silent one gets the full prison sentence, and the other goes free; Assume that those who don't confess will be jailed for 12 months.
2. **If both testify**, they both receive a reduced sentence; Assume, both of them were sentenced to 8 months in prison.
3. **If neither testifies**, they both get a moderate sentence; Assume, each will get 1 month in prison.
4. Assume that the two suspects don't know each other, and they just want to minimize their time in prison. should they confess?

<br>

<center> <img src="modules\prisoner_dilemma_example_1.png" alt="Prisoner Dilemma" width="100%" /> </center>

<br>

The dilemma arises because, while the best outcome for the individuals as a whole is for both to remain silent, **each prisoner has an incentive to testify, as it offers a better individual outcome regardless of the other's choice**. 

The outcomes of the Prisoners' Dilemma game are as follows:

1. Both players choose to defect (DD): **Mutually preferable**. The concept of a "reasonable outcome" in the context of the Prisoner's Dilemma game refers to a result that is mutually preferable for all parties involved. The moderate sentence outcome is considered the most reasonable, as it is the only outcome in which both players receive a better outcome
2. One player chooses to defect and the other chooses to cooperate: The defector benefits from the cooperation of the other, receiving a reduced sentence, while the cooperative player receives the full prison sentence.
3. Both players choose to cooperate (CC): **Reasonable outcome**. "Reasonable outcome" in the context of the Prisoner's Dilemma game refers to a result that is mutually preferable for all parties involved. In this outcome, both players receive a reduced sentence. 

"What makes this configuration disturbing is that even if each side prefers CC to DD (and each knows that this is the other's preference) the result can be DD because each is driven by the hope of gaining its first choice - which would be to exploit the other (DC) and its fear that, if it cooperates, the other will exploit it (CD)." ([Jervis, 1988](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2010216)).

# Prisoner's Dilemma in International Relation Context

The Prisoner's Dilemma is often used as a theoretical framework to understand and analyze various situations in international relations. One classic example is the dilemma of arms races and disarmament. In this context, two or more states face the choice of either **arming themselves** (defecting) to ensure their security or **disarming** (cooperating) to reduce the risk of conflict and promote stability. If one state chooses to arm itself while the other disarms, the disarming state may be left vulnerable, resulting in a less favorable outcome. However, if both states engage in an arms race, it can lead to a situation where both are less secure and incur higher costs, representing a suboptimal outcome similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma. This example illustrates how the dynamics of cooperation and conflict in international relations can be analyzed using the framework of the Prisoner's Dilemma.

Example: Why states' attack each other and make World War I?

**Assumption**
- The country's leaders at the time believed in the power of weapons and offensive tactics
- Although all leaders prefer to make peace, no one wants to be attacked first
- First strike = advantage at war

**World Condition**
1. In this world there are only two countries (for example, Germany and France)
2. There are only 2 strategies in this game, namely **arming themselves** (defecting) or **disarming** (cooperating)
3. Outcomes of the game:

- A state arming themselves and the other's will disarming
- All states' disarming (peace)
- All states' arming themselves (lead to war)
- A state disarming and the other's arming themselves

<br>

<center> <img src="modules\prisoner_dilemma_example_2.png" alt="Prisoner Dilemma" width="100%" /> </center>

<br>

Because all countries don't want to get attacked first, it is possible all actors will arming themselves because they want to take the advantages (if it leads to war)

<exercise id="12" title="Critial Theory">  

Critical theory emerged as an influential perspective within international relations (IR) theory in the late 1980s and 1990s. The origins of critical theory in IR lie in thought associated with the Frankfurt School. Frankfurt School thinking was inspired by Marxist and Western Marxist theorizing, but sought to revise and reformulate many key understandings of these strands of thought. 

Critical theory aims to move beyond simply describing reality, instead seeking to interpretively engage with the open-ended unfolding of social relations and identities in world politics. It is concerned with exposing oppression in international relations and representing underrepresented actors and perspectives. Critical theorists are committed to reflexivity, skepticism of fact/value separation, and self-awareness.

## Frankfurt School

The Frankfurt School refers to a group of scholars associated with the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt, Germany in the early 20th century. Their work laid important theoretical foundations for the development of critical theory. 

Three key thinkers from the Frankfurt School made important contributions:

- Max Horkheimer formulated a distinction between traditional and critical theory. Traditional theory aims to understand or explain society. Critical theory, in contrast, has an emancipatory purpose - it aims to critique society and promote social change. 
- Theodor Adorno initiated critical reflections on the role of the "culture industry" in modern capitalist societies. He argued that mass cultural production manipulates the population ideologically to maintain the status quo.
- Jürgen Habermas developed a theory of communicative ethics focused on rational dialogue. He posited that social progress happens through undistorted communication oriented toward mutual understanding. This ethical approach became very influential in critical theory.

## Early Critical IR Theory

IR theory could be said to arise in two phases. The first phase was concerned primarily with questions of epistemology, and placed emphasis on critique of science and objectivity in mainstream IR theories as well as critiques of state-centrism. Considered members of the postmodern strand of critical IR theory, such theorists, like Yosef Lapid for example, emphasized the need for plural perspectives and postpositivist in the study of international politics. 

Growing out of disenchantment with neorealism as IR's paradigmatic dominant theory, early critical theorists aimed to move beyond an understanding of the purpose of theory as simply describing an objective reality. Instead, its purpose was understood to be interpretive of reality as an open-ended totality of changing and unfolding social relations and identities in international relations.

## Key Early Thinkers

Critical IR theory emerged in the 1980s and early 1990s as a reaction to dominant neorealist and neoliberal theories in the field. Several key thinkers were instrumental in establishing critical theory as an alternative approach for studying international relations:

- **Robert Cox**: A Canadian scholar, Cox aimed to develop a critical theory of international politics that examined how historically-specific power structures and social forces shape world order. His approach challenged positivist methodologies and emphasized the interplay between theory and practice. Cox highlighted the role of historical structures in limiting political action.
- **Richard Ashley**: An American scholar, Ashley advocated for a post-positivist epistemology in IR theory. He critiqued mainstream IR theories as state-centric and ignorant of language, arguing these obscured the role of identity and discourse in global politics. Ashley emphasized interpretivism and the idea of anarchy as a social construction. 
- **Mark Hoffman**: Hoffman, another American scholar, synthesized critical social theory and poststructuralism to critically analyze global politics. He focused on deconstructing core concepts like sovereignty and anarchy, exposing their contradictory meanings. Hoffman argued mainstream IR theory falsely universalized Western experiences and marginalized other perspectives.

These three thinkers were instrumental in the early development of critical IR theory as an alternative to dominant positivist approaches. Their focus on critical reflexivity, discourse, and marginalized voices formed the foundation for the critical theory tradition in international relations.

## Later Phase

In the later phase, the pragmatic and normatively based critical IR theories entailed focus on questions of dialogue and dialogical ethics, questions of political community and recognition, and an interest in political economy.

Habermas's thought has been very important here. It has provided the cornerstone for development of theoretical interpretations of dialogue and ethics in international politics. Habermas emphasized communicative action and intersubjective dialogue as the basis for developing moral norms. His theory of communicative action has deeply influenced critical IR theory's understanding of international ethics. 

Many critics continue, however, to question how precisely to understand communicative action and dialogue in international politics today. Here, difficulties in cultural and moral conflicts and consequential non- or misrecognition of participants, as well as the lack of a fundamentally democratic forum for dialogue among global actors is among the most common challenges.

Critical IR theory in this phase also developed a sustained interest in global political economy, examining the role of neoliberal capitalism in shaping international politics and global inequalities. Habermas's ideas about communicative rationality were drawn upon to develop alternative understandings of political economy centered on deliberative democracy.

## Challenges

Many critics continue, however, to question how precisely to understand communicative action and dialogue in international politics today. Here, difficulties in cultural and moral conflicts and consequential non- or misrecognition of participants, as well as the lack of a fundamentally democratic forum for dialogue among global actors is among the most common challenges. 

Cultural and moral conflicts pose significant obstacles for meaningful dialogue in global politics. When fundamental differences in worldviews, values, and identities lead to misunderstanding or tension between actors, the potential for communicative action is diminished. Overcoming these divides requires empathy,openness to alternate perspectives, and willingness to critically examine one's own assumptions and biases. However, the persistence of ingrained preconceptions makes bridging such gulfs extremely difficult.

Furthermore, the absence of an inclusive, egalitarian global platform for international dialogue represents a major impediment. With no formal arena for equitable and non-coercive discourse between all global stakeholders, existing power dynamics marginalize and exclude vulnerable voices. Fundamentally undemocratic global governance institutions dominated by a handful of powerful states do not foster the trust, reciprocity, and shared understanding necessary for communicative action. Genuine dialogue ultimately requires a more representative, participatory, and horizontal global order.

The challenges of cultural conflicts and unequal access hinder the realization of communicative ethics on a global scale. Achieving mutual understanding through open, reasoned discourse remains an aspirational ideal that critical IR theorists continue striving to promote. Overcoming these obstacles is essential for empowering marginalized peoples and democratizing international relations.

## Risse and Linklater

Thomas Risse's intervention on communicative action, through his notion of the logic of communication, was an important catalyst in the development of Habermas's ideas in IR. Risse argued that the logic of communication can help facilitate understanding between actors with different worldviews. Through dialogue, actors can come to recognize each other and develop shared meanings, despite starting from very different perspectives. 

In moving towards development of a systematic critical theory of international relations, Andrew Linklater's thought on political community has been a very important theoretical intervention. Linklater emphasized three key elements:

- The normative domain - Emphasis on dialogue and dialogical ethics, as well as move towards world community. 
- The sociological domain - Encompassed the social determinants of international structures of the international state system.  
- The praxeological domain - The actions and tasks of implementing and enforcing the principles of justice, freedom, and equality.

Linklater argued that through communicative action, a more inclusive political community could be developed that transcends state boundaries. This would require challenging exclusionary practices and hierarchies in global politics.

## Strands of Critical Theory

Critical theory in IR encompasses two key strands of thought. Both strands commit to embodying underrepresented actors and voices in the field of international relations, and are therefore concerned with exposing various sources of oppression that may otherwise go unacknowledged. 

A key unifying element between these two strands is the emphasis on ontological, epistemological, and methodological plurality in theorizing. That is, critical theory rejects the notion that there is one universal way of understanding the nature of reality, knowledge, and appropriate research methods in international relations. It embraces multiple perspectives, especially those from marginalized groups, as crucial for producing knowledge and theorizing.  

This ontological, epistemological, and methodological openness exposes critical theory to accusations of relativism. However, critical theorists argue that exposing oppression requires embracing pluralism to give voice to marginalized peoples. A rigid positivist approach that claims perfect objective knowledge is itself a tool of oppression, as it silences alternative voices. Critical theory thus maintains skepticism of any claims to universal truth or totalizing theories. 

Overall, critical theory's commitment to pluralism serves to understand and expose the multiple intersecting sources of oppression in global politics. This in turn can support emancipatory goals of justice, freedom and equality.

## Case Study - Arab Spring

The wave of protests that erupted in 2011 against authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and North Africa, known as the Arab Spring, exposed not only the endemic problems underpinning authoritarian governance in the region but also raised critical questions about the problematic positions of Western states regarding their support for authoritarian rulers. 

Critical IR theory can elucidate the variety of underlying social factors that shaped the Arab Spring, such as the evolving political identity and consciousness of Arab publics, the failures of neoliberal economic policies, the lack of political will to establish the rule of law, and the enabling role of social media platforms. In essence, critical theory provides a reflexive analysis of the tensions between the static and transformational political and social forces at play.

An important perspective is offered by Critical Security Studies, a school of thought that probes how notions of security are constructed and weaponized in international politics. For example, Richard Wyn Jones contends that traditional security studies remains an applied research program rooted in instrumental rationality. Columba Peoples argues that missile defense represents a longstanding effort to normalize the symbols, means, and representations of security.

# Conclusion 

Critical theory in international relations remains vitally important due to its commitment to critical reflexivity and discursive ethics. Critical reflexivity is key, as critical theorists emphasize being skeptical of fact/value separations in theorizing. This requires theorists to have constant awareness of their own assumptions and biases.  

Jürgen Habermas's discursive and communicative ethics is also crucial for critical IR theory. His emphasis on ideal speech situations opens new horizons for theorizing international politics in an ethical, egalitarian, and democratic manner. Critical theorists have built upon Habermas's insights to explore discourse, dialogue, and deliberation in global politics.

However, putting such discursive ethics into practice remains challenging due to cultural conflicts and lack of global democratic forums. Further research is needed on how to implement ethical communication among diverse global actors.  

Globalization provides an important context for critical IR theory today. Critical theorists can analyze issues of global civil society, empowerment, and justice within an increasingly interconnected world. The open-ended nature of globalization suggests creative possibilities for more emancipatory international relations.

Overall, critical theory furnishes international relations with imaginative and reflective tools to critique oppressive structures and work towards a more ethical global community. Its emphasis on reflexivity, discourse ethics, and emancipation ensure critical theory will continue illuminating new possibilities in world politics.
