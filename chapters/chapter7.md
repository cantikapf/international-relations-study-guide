<exercise id="1" title="Introduction To International Relations Theories">  



The study of international relations (IR) emerged as an academic discipline after World War I as scholars and practitioners sought to understand the conditions that led to the "World War" and how future wars could be prevented. Since then, IR has evolved from its early idealist roots into a diverse field encompassing multiple theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches.

## Ontology, Epistemology and Methodology 

Each theoretical position in IR revolves around assumptions concerning ontology, epistemology, and methodology. Ontology refers to the nature of reality and what constitutes the fundamental building blocks of the social world. Epistemology examines how we can come to know this reality and the possibility of gaining objective knowledge. Methodology involves the techniques used to uncover and analyze information about world politics. 

While positivism, a prevailing philosophy of science, has long dominated IR scholarship, particularly in the United States, its recent discrediting as a scientific practice does not diminish its historical significance in shaping the discipline. Positivism assumes an objective, observable reality exists independently of observers. Knowledge derives from sensory experience of this external reality. The social world functions according to generalizable laws analogous to the natural sciences. Positivism favors quantitative, empirical methods for uncovering causal explanations and predictive laws.

In contrast, post-positivist approaches in IR question the existence of an observer-independent reality. Social phenomena have inherently subjective qualities not governed by immutable laws. Post-positivism emphasizes understanding the contextual meaning of events, using qualitative methods interpretive of subjective human experiences. 

Divergent meta-theoretical assumptions between positivism and post-positivism have fueled pivotal debates within IR on what constitutes scientific study and whether the field qualifies as a science. The different positions in IR carry distinct ontological, epistemological and methodological viewpoints that shape how theorists conceptualize and study global politics.

## Positivism and IR 

Positivism, a prevailing philosophy of science, has long dominated IR scholarship, particularly in the United States. As a school of thought, positivism emphasizes empirical data and scientific methods, holding that authentic knowledge is based on experience of natural phenomena and their properties and relations. Positivism rejects speculation based on spiritual or metaphysical sources and maintains that research should be value-free and objective. 

In IR, positivism influenced efforts to establish the field as an empirical science, favoring quantitative methods and statistical analysis. Positivism shaped theoretical work seeking to identify universal causal explanations and generalizable patterns, aligned with principles of logic and empiricism. This approach enabled IR scholars to construct theoretical models and derive testable hypotheses about state behavior and world politics.

However, positivism's standing as a credible scientific framework has weakened, as critics have highlighted limitations in its core assumptions. Post-positivism maintains that pure objectivity is impossible and that observations remain theory-laden. Social constructionism argues that the social environment influences our perceptions and sense of reality. Interpretivism emphasizes understanding meanings and subjective experiences rather than external causes. 

These critiques have undermined positivism and sparked vigorous debates about appropriate scientific methods in studying global politics. While positivism retains influence, its dominance has diminished. Yet its historical role in shaping IR as an academic discipline remains significant.

## Defining IR as a Science 

Two pivotal meta-theoretical questions have persistently defined IR: what constitutes the scientific study of world politics and the perennial debate over whether IR qualifies as a science. IR scholars have long wrestled with defining the field as a science, sparking significant debates over what constitutes scientific study and rigor when analyzing global politics and relations between states. 

Many have critiqued IR as failing to meet key criteria of a science, lacking theoretical coherence, an agreed upon methodology, or defined boundaries as an academic discipline. The complexity of international relations, with countless variables interacting in dynamic and unpredictable ways, poses challenges for systematic theory building and testing. IR's subject matter - the behavior of states driven by national interests and power - is difficult to measure and quantify precisely. 

However, defenders argue IR utilizes rigorous methods of hypothesis testing, statistical analysis, and modeling rooted in scientific rationalism. The prominence of quantitative approaches and formal modeling reflect IR's scientific aspirations. While lacking the precision of natural sciences, IR develops contingent generalizations and applies scientific logic in studying world politics. The debate continues between those arguing IR cannot attain the standards of a true science versus others believing it has evolved into a mature, replicable discipline. How IR negotiates scientific norms and objectivity versus interpretive methods shapes the field's scope and impact.

## First Great Debate 

The First Great Debate emerged during and after World War I, pitting **idealists against realists**. Idealists advocated for institutions and reason to control human irrationalities that they believed had led to the Great War, while realists critiqued them for focusing on how the world "ought to be" rather than pragmatically addressing objective realities. 

The idealists, led by figures like Woodrow Wilson, supported the establishment of international organizations like the League of Nations to promote cooperation, collective security, and the peaceful resolution of disputes between nations. They believed that binding rules, norms and institutions could overcome selfish national interests and aggression.

In contrast, realists like E.H. Carr rejected these ideas as naive and utopian. They argued that power politics and national self-interest necessarily shape state behavior in an anarchic international system lacking a supreme authority. Rather than imagining an ideal world, realists focused on world politics as it existed, emphasizing power, military capabilities and the balance of power between nation-states. 

This seminal debate helped define the contours of the nascent field of IR, with idealism fading as realist accounts of WWI proved more compelling to make sense of the interwar period. The Great Debate established realism as the dominant paradigm in IR for decades to come.

## Second Great Debate

The Second Great Debate in the 1960s centered on **methodology**, dividing traditionalists defending a humanistic approach from modernizers pushing for greater methodological rigor. This debate emerged from dissatisfaction with the prevalence of descriptive and philosophical approaches lacking systematic methods of analysis. 

The traditionalists believed the study of IR should focus on historically-oriented, qualitative research to capture the complexity of political life. They emphasized the role of subjective human consciousness and moral purpose in global politics. Traditionalists argued for retaining interdisciplinary flexibility rather than narrow methodological constraints.

In contrast, the modernizers pushed for theoretically-driven empirical research drawing on quantitative methods from economics and other social sciences. They advocated for greater methodological rigor to develop generalizable theoretical explanations of world politics. The modernizers wanted the study of IR to emulate the hard sciences and critiqued traditional approaches as interpretive, philosophical, and insufficiently scientific. 

## Third Great Debate (Inter-Paradigm Debate)

The Third Great Debate in the 1970s and 1980s engaged **realist, pluralist (liberal), and globalist (marxist)** positions in understanding and explaining international processes.

The realist position asserted that states were motivated by self-interest and the pursuit of power in an anarchic world where there was no overarching authority to regulate their interactions and they viewed International Relations through a prism of competitive relations. Realists emphasized nation-state sovereignty and saw international institutions and organizations as epiphenomenal or marginal phenomena inasmuch as they did not directly influence state behavior. 

Pluralists challenged realism by suggesting that states were not the only relevant actors in international politics. Pluralists pointed to the existence and growing influence of non-state and transnational actors and their interactions with states. They emphasized examining relationships among these various types of actors to understand global politics. They also acknowledge realist perspective but also advocated the mutual benefits for states through greater cooperative relations.

Globalist critiqued both realists and pluralists for taking the state-centric framework of international politics for granted, and for ignoring capitalism's influence on economic and social structures, as well as conflicts stemming from economic classes. Marxists advocated analyzing global capitalism's impacts on international relations and conflicts between states and other actors.

## Fourth Great Debate

The Fourth Debate, characterizing IR since the mid-1980s, involves deep-seated disagreements on what the discipline should study and how. This debate emerged as positivism's dominance as the primary philosophy of science in IR began to erode. It can be characterized in many ways: as a debate between explaining (scientific) and understanding (interpretive), between positivism (empiricist) and post-positivism and between rationalism and reflectivism.

On one side of the debate are explanatory theorists, who align with positivism and believe IR should seek to identify general causal relationships and laws that can explain international processes and events. These scholars aim to test hypotheses and build empirical models to explain phenomena like interstate wars, alliance formations, or economic agreements.

On the other side are interpretive scholars, who argue that IR should focus more on understanding social life and the internal meanings created by social actors. Interpretivists reject the positivist notion that the social world can be studied like the natural/physical world. They emphasize the importance of subjective beliefs, perceptions, shared meanings, and social constructs. 

While explanatory theorists align with quantitative methods, interpretivists promote qualitative approaches centered on social meanings. This methodological divide underpins the substantive disagreements over what IR should study and how. The Fourth Debate brought these longstanding tensions between positivism and post-positivist alternatives to the fore in IR.

## Conceptions of IR Theory

There are divergent conceptions of what constitutes a theory in international relations scholarship. These include:

- **Explanatory Theories** - Seek to identify general causes and effects, make predictions, and provide explanations. Aligned with positivism. Example theories are realism, liberalism, and Marxism.
- **Critical Theories** - Challenge prevailing theoretical orthodoxies and aim to reveal structures of power and domination. Associated with the Frankfurt School. 
- **Normative Theories** - Make value judgements about ideal models for political order and justice. Prescriptive in nature.
- **Reflectivist/Interpretive Theories** - Emphasize understanding meanings, reasons, and subjective experiences rather than causes and effects. Associated with constructivism and post-structuralism.
- **Constitutive Theories** - Argue identities and interests are constructed through social interaction, rather than given prior to it. 

There are divergent views on issues like objectivity, theory testing, and the relationship between theory and practice. This underscores the importance of considering meta-theoretical issues and assumptions in evaluating IR theories. Different conceptions of theory play crucial roles in shaping the IR discipline.

## Classical Realism Core Concepts

Classical Realism introduces several key concepts that shape its worldview:

### Groupism

Groupism refers to the significance of human groups, especially nation-states and nationalism, for survival in the realist perspective. It emphasizes that states are the principal actors in global politics and that nationalism binds people together under a common identity to form these coherent groups. Alliance formation between states is an extension of groupism.

### Egoism

Egoism is the view that self-interest is the driving motivator behind political behavior. Classical realists see egoism as rooted in human nature - people and states seek to promote their own interests above others. Egoism manifests in the rational pursuit of national interests by states in the international arena.

### Power-centrism

Power-centrism, also called hegemony, highlights power inequalities as a fundamental feature of politics and human affairs. The realist world is marked by some states exerting greater power and influence over others. Power dynamics shape relationships between states as they seek security and influence.

These interlinked concepts form the building blocks of how classical realists understand global politics and inform their perspective emphasize the primacy of the nation-state and national interests in an environment where power determines outcomes. The rational calculation of interest defined in terms of power is key.

## Main Assumptions of Realism

Realism makes the following key assumptions about international relations:

- States are the principal actors in international affairs. Realism views states as unitary, geographically defined entities that make rational decisions to maximize their security and power. States are the most important units in the global arena.
- The international system is anarchic, lacking any overarching authority. Without a world government, states must ultimately rely on themselves to ensure their continued survival and interests. This creates an environment of self-help and uncertainty.
- States seek to maximize their power and influence relative to others. Power is a means to an end of security and survival. States build up military and economic power to leverage their position and interests internationally.
- The distribution of power is a defining feature of international politics. Realism focuses on the balance of power between states and alliances as a determining factor in international outcomes. Power dynamics constrain and shape state behavior.
- Morality and ideology have little influence in global affairs. Realism maintains that states make foreign policy decisions based on calculations of power and self-interest, not ethical standards. Moral principles do not override strategic considerations.
- Human nature is egoistic and power-driven. Realism has a pessimistic view of human nature, seeing it as inherently competitive and conflictual especially in international anarchy. This shapes how states interact.

## Expanding on Principles of Realism

Classical Realism, as articulated by Hans Morgenthau in his seminal work "Politics Among Nations", expands on the core principles of the Realist perspective in international relations.

Morgenthau emphasizes that Realism is grounded in objective laws rooted in unchanging human nature. He asserts that human nature is selfish, driven by the desire for power and dominance over others. This forms the basis for understanding politics and power dynamics between nation-states.

Additionally, Morgenthau puts forth the concept of looking at and understanding the world through the lens of "interest defined as power". Interests of nation-states in the international arena are primarily viewed through the desire to maximize their own power and influence. Power becomes the main tool through which states pursue their national interests on the global stage.

Finally, Classical Realism stresses the autonomy of the political realm, separate from morality. Morgenthau argues that morality has no place guiding the conduct of nation-states and their foreign policies. The global arena is an amoral space where each state rationally and objectively pursues its interests defined in terms of power. Ethical considerations are set aside in favor of rational calculations around maximizing power.

In summary, Classical Realism expands on key principles of objective laws, interest as power, and the autonomy of politics. These serve as the theoretical foundations for this dominant perspective in analyzing dynamics between nation-states. Power reigns supreme in an anarchic international order with no overarching authority.

## Domestic & International Link

Classical realists blur the distinction between the domestic and international, viewing them as expressions of the same human drives. Thucydides and Morgenthau emphasize the cohesiveness of community in maintaining order and restraint, both domestically and internationally.

A core tenet of classical realism is the connection between domestic politics and international relations. Rather than seeing them as separate spheres, classical realists argue that domestic and foreign affairs are interlinked, stemming from the same root causes in human nature and society.

Specifically, classical realists highlight the role of community in promoting order and restraint within a society as well as between societies. The cohesiveness of communities domestically helps foster shared identities, norms and values that can then underpin stability and cooperation globally. Thucydides emphasized how justice, moderation and shared culture within the Greek city-states enabled alliances and collective action against outside threats.

Similarly, Morgenthau pointed to national unity and vibrant civic participation as critical for order domestically, and for prudent, restrained policies internationally. Strong communities with a sense of shared purpose are a check against unrestrained egoism and power politics. Domestically, this order enables stable state power. Internationally, it facilitates alliances and security bargains between states.

## Balance of Power

The balance of power is an important dynamic in international relations according to the realist perspective. On this topic, there are some notable differences between classical and contemporary realists.

Classical realists like Thucydides emphasize the significance of alliances in maintaining order and stability between states. Alliances allow states to check the power of potential hegemons and prevent any one state from dominating the rest. Thucydides appreciates the complex balancing acts involved in alliance formation and maintenance.

Contemporary realists, on the other hand, prioritize national power over justice and morality in international affairs. From their view, the foremost goal of any state is to maximize its share of world power relative to other states. Alliances are simply means to this end, vehicles for accruing power. Justice and restraint are secondary factors in the contemporary realist's calculations.

So while classical realists see alliances as crucial for order and restraint, contemporary realists view power itself as the primary force in international politics. This divergence highlights an evolution in realist thought from its ancient origins to modern theories of international relations.

# Change & Modernization

Examining change and modernization, classical realists associate change with modernization, bringing shifts in identities and conceptions of security.

Classical realists like Thucydides and Morgenthau recognize that modernization impacts both domestic politics and international relations. As societies modernize, new technologies, economic systems, and cultural values emerge. This can destabilize traditional identities, norms and ideas around security.

For example, the spread of digital technology and social media has rapidly connected people across borders, enabling new transnational identities to form. Globalization of markets has also shifted conceptions of economic security. Climate change is transforming how states think about environmental and energy security.

Classical realists caution that rapid modernization can outpace the ability of institutions and communities to adapt. This is why they advocate judiciously blending old and new values during periods of change, in order to maintain stability and order. Core values around justice and restraint help check leaders' ambitions and build unity.

At the international level, classical realists warn that shifting identities and interests during modernization can exacerbate tensions between states. As relative power changes, status quo powers may cling to old notions of security and attempt to suppress emerging powers. Wise statecraft requires carefully balancing continuity and change across both domestic and international realms.

## Justice in International Relations

For classical realists, justice plays a crucial role in shaping how other states understand and respond to a country. While contemporary realists prioritize power over justice in international affairs, classical realists emphasize justice as essential for maintaining order and restraint both domestically and internationally.

Classical realists like Thucydides appreciate the cohesiveness of community in maintaining order and promoting self-restraint. According to this view, justice enables order by aligning the means and ends of foreign policy with community values. Morgenthau similarly highlights justice as foundational for a stable international system built on order and restraint.

The absence of morality and ethics in the international arena is a core tenet of structural realism. However, classical realists diverge on this point, underscoring justice and morality as ensuring prudent foreign policy aligned with the community's interests. Unjust means often lead to disorder and blowback effects that undermine the ends being pursued.

## Iraq War Case Study

A classical realist perspective provides insight into the tragic outcome of the Iraq War, underscoring the dangers of hubris and the contradiction between a state's proclaimed values and the means used to achieve them.

In the lead-up to the invasion in 2003, the Bush administration displayed tremendous overconfidence, making misplaced assumptions about the Iraqi people's reception of American forces as liberators. This hubris blinded policymakers to the reality that most Iraqis would view the unprovoked invasion of their country as an act of imperialist aggression, not one of liberation.

Furthermore, the ideals behind the war - spreading democracy, protecting human rights - stood in stark contradiction to the means used - an unprovoked invasion justified with manipulated intelligence, the use of torture, the flouting of international law. As classical realists emphasize, justice and community values are crucial for how a state's actions are perceived abroad. By contradicting its own principles, the United States damaged its legitimacy and moral authority.

The tragic aftermath of the Iraq War underscores key warnings from classical realists about the dangers of hubris and the exercise of unrestrained power. Prudence and wisdom are vital to prevent outcomes like Iraq, where the world's most powerful state unleashed horrific devastation in pursuit of idealistic goals using unjust means. The restraint born of caution, humility and respect for shared values serves as an antidote to reckless exercises of power divorced from moral considerations.

<exercise id="3" title="Liberalism">  

- **Analytical units**: State and non-state actors are important
- **View of actors**: State can be disaggregated, some components may function transnationally
- **Behavioral dynamics**: Foreign policy making and transnational processes involve conflict, bargaining, coalition and compromise which means not necessarily resulting in optimal outcomes
- **Issues**: Multiple agendas, socio-economics, welfare as important issue

## Key Assumption

1. The belief in the rational qualities of individuals
2. Faith in the feasibility of progress in the social life
3. The conviction that humans, despite their self-interest, are able to cooperate and construct a more peaceful and harmonious society

---

## Three Set of Liberal Rights

Within the liberal framework, three sets of rights form the foundation. These include:

1. Individual rights to the right to private property
2. Right necessary to protect and promote the capacity of social economy rights
3. Democratic participation or representation

Liberals emphasize the importance of private property rights, believing individuals have a right to own property and engage in market transactions freely. This enables individuals to pursue their economic interests and contributes to an efficient allocation of resources and economic prosperity.

In addition, liberals argue that some rights are necessary to promote social welfare and regulate the economy. These include rights to education, healthcare, social security, and labor regulations. While valuing free markets, liberals contend that governments should provide services and protections to support a thriving economy and society.

Finally, liberals stress democratic participation and representation. Citizens should have the right to elect their leaders and influence government policy. Democratically elected governments, representing the will of the people, can best protect individual liberties. Through voting, civil liberties, and active civic participation, citizens can shape their society.
## Realist Constraint

The realist perspective presents an alternative view of the international system. According to realists, the international arena operates in a state of anarchy, with no overarching authority to govern relations between sovereign states. This creates an inherently competitive environment, where states must be continuously aware of potential threats from other nations.

**Immanuel Kant's** liberal institutionalist perspective contrasts with realism but still accommodates notions of conflict among sovereign states. Kant recognized that states exist in an anarchical system and acknowledged tendencies toward conflict driven by self-interest. However, he believed it was possible to transcend realist constraints through reason.

Kant argued that human nature contains both unsocial and social qualities. Therefore, conflict can be overcome through adherence to universal principles derived from reason. His perspective suggests that shared norms and institutions can facilitate cooperation and restraint even in an anarchical system of states pursuing self-interest.

While realists emphasize power dynamics as the key driver of state behavior, Kant highlighted the role of ideas, principles, and identity. He proposed that republican constitutions with representative governments, rule of law, separation of powers, and protection of civil liberties would promote peaceful external relations. Kant theorized that leaders accountable to their citizens would be constrained from waging aggressive wars.

Furthermore, Kant envisioned increased economic ties between states interdependent through trade and commerce. He posited that these relationships would provide incentives for resolving disputes peacefully to avoid the costs of severed economic links. International organizations could also foster cooperation by establishing norms and offering mechanisms for mediating conflicts.

Therefore, Kant's liberal institutionalism acknowledges the realist view of an anarchical system with self-interested states, but contends that practical reason, shared identities, and growing interdependence can transform state behavior toward more peaceful ends. His perspective accommodates conflict but suggests possibilities to circumvent power dynamics and mitigate tendencies toward war.

## Kantian Triangle

<br>

<center> <img src="modules\Kantian_triangle.png" alt="Kantian Triangle" width="70%" /> </center>

<br>

Kantian Triangle is the illustration of Kantian perspective on world politics, which is about an interdependent system of influences, which are seen to exist in a series of 'feedback loops' with each the major forces strengthening the others. The illustration show that the system directly promoting peace. 

States are less likely to go to war with each other as more of them become **democratic**. When there is a disagreement, democracies usually try to work things out peacefully instead of violently. In turn, this democratic peace leads to more trade and membership in foreign groups.

**Economic interdependence** in the economy also makes war less likely. When countries need each other for trade, raw materials, business, and markets, they have strong reasons to keep the peace. Stopping trade and imposing economic sanctions can cost a lot, so states that rely on each other will try to settle their differences peacefully. Strong rules for foreign trade and investment help keep peace between countries. In addition, democratic nations engage in trade with one another because to the increased likelihood of honoring trade agreements and respecting foreign property rights.

The third pillar is taking part in **international organizations (IO)**. Groups like the UN, WTO, and ICC help states settle disagreements, make decisions about disputes, use penalties to stop aggression, and set up places to negotiate. These institutions make it harder to go to war and easier to reach an agreement. Over time, these norms of teamwork become part of each country's foreign policy. Moreover, beside maintaining the peace, IO also involved in promoting democracy.

When these three forces work together, they make beneficial **feedback loops**. Trade and international organizations work better when there is more democracy. This makes democratic systems stronger. Growing global markets are a reason to make international institutions stronger. When institutions set shared rules and norms, democracies feel safe growing their economic and political ties. All of these factors work together to make the world a more peaceful place.
