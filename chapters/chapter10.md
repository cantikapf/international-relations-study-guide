# What is foreign policy analysis (FPA)?

Foreign policy analysis (FPA) is a subfield of international relations that focuses on examining the processes and decision-making that shape a country's foreign policy. It aims to explain the strategies and behaviors that governments employ in their interactions with other international actors.

FPA emerged as a distinctive field of study in the 1950s and 1960s, as scholars sought to open the "black box" of foreign policy decision-making. Whereas traditional international relations theory focused on systemic factors like the distribution of power, FPA adopts a more nuanced approach that considers the domestic and individual-level variables that affect foreign policy choices. It draws on insights from multiple disciplines, including political science, history, economics, psychology, and sociology.

At its core, FPA examines the human dimension of international relations. Rather than treating states as unitary rational actors, it recognizes that foreign policy is ultimately crafted by individuals and groups. FPA scholars analyze the inputs and processes that inform foreign policy, ranging from a leader's ideology and personality to bureaucratic politics and interest group influence. By shedding light on how foreign policy is formulated, FPA seeks to explain the strategic calculations and political behaviors that underpin statecraft.

Over recent decades, FPA has established itself as a vibrant area of international relations scholarship. Its expansive analytical toolkit provides diverse perspectives on the complex factors that shape foreign policy decision-making and implementation. As global affairs grow increasingly multifaceted, the field's integrative approach offers essential insights into the human side of international relations.

## History and Development

Foreign policy analysis emerged as a subfield of international relations in the 1950s after World War II. The objective of foreign policy analysis is to understand the processes and strategies behind a state's foreign policy decisions and actions.

Whereas international relations focuses on relations between states and the international system, foreign policy analysis zooms in to examine the processes, calculations, and decisions behind a particular state's foreign policy. It seeks to understand why states make certain decisions, who the key actors and influences are behind those decisions, and how the specific context shapes the policy choices available.

Foreign policy is often studied by focusing on a single country and decision (e.g. a U.S. president's decision on the use of force) or by comparing decisions across countries (e.g. environmental policy in the U.S., U.K., Germany, etc.). Foreign policy analysis provides frameworks for systematically analyzing the factors that shape foreign policy in order to build up middle-range theories that can be generalized and applied to other cases.

# Focus of Foreign Policy Analysis

While international relations scholars are often interested in specific foreign policies that states adopt, FPA focuses more on the overall foreign policy process. FPA examines how foreign policies are formulated and implemented, rather than just analyzing the policy outputs. It looks at the various factors that shape how state leaders arrive at foreign policy decisions.

Some key aspects of foreign policy analysis include:

- Understanding the process through which foreign policy decisions are made, such as the roles of different government institutions, interest groups, public opinion, and individual leaders.
- Identifying the factors that constrain or enable foreign policy options for state leaders, like a country's relative power, economic conditions, and relationships with allies.
- Studying how psychological factors like perception, misperception, and cognitive biases can influence foreign policy choices.
- Examining whether foreign policy decisions are made through rational cost-benefit analyses versus being shaped by non-rational factors like emotions, values, or historical analogies.
- Analyzing the domestic and bureaucratic politics that affect how state interests and preferences are defined in foreign policy.

# Three Paradigmatic works of Foreign Policy Analysis

**Richard Synder** contributed a focus on the decision making process itself as part of the explanation, rather than just foreign policy outputs. For example, the decision making process, such as voting, will influence a country's foreign policy.

**James Rosenau** developed actor-specific theory that would lead to the development of generalizable propositions at the level of middle-range theory. Based on Rosenau's work, a policy is based on the actor behavior. For example, we think that in the case of a trade war, the US acted aggressively because overall the US attitude was like that from the start.

**Harold and Margaret Sprout** believed that foreign policy can only be explained with reference to the psycho-milieu (the psychological, situational, political and social contexts) of the individuals involved in decision making. They thought that foreign policy can be explained based on psychology or reaction to the context. For example, Soeharto's authoritarian behavior had an impact on Indonesian foreign policy during the New Order era.

# Level of Analysis in Foreign Policy Decision Making

## Individual-level analysis

Individual-level analysis involves understanding how the human decision-making process influences foreign policy. Foreign policy making is much more likely than domestic policy making to be centered on a countryâ€™s top leadership.

Some key factors considered in individual-level analysis:

- **Cognitive Factors**: How do decision makers perceive the world and process information? What are their core beliefs and paradigms? How do they interpret new information? Cognitive biases can skew perceptions.
- **Emotional Factors**: Emotions like fear, anger, or grief can shape policy choices. Stressful situations may impair rational thinking. Psychological traits like risk tolerance play a role.
- **Psychological Factors**: Personality traits, mental health, ego, ambitions - these can determine if leaders are aggressive, cautious, reactive, or proactive. Psychological biases influence interpretation of events.
- **Biological Factors**: Health issues, medications, sleep patterns, or substance use can impact judgment and energy levels. Age and generational experiences may shape perspectives.
- **Perceptions**: How do leaders view threats, opportunities, and options? Flawed threat perceptions can lead to missteps. Optimism or pessimism colors choices. Selective perception reinforces biases.

Understanding how these individual-level factors shape foreign policy decision making provides insight into why leaders make certain choices. Psychology, emotions, biology, and perceptions fundamentally influence human behavior and judgment.

## State Level Analysis

State level analysis examines how factors within a state influence its foreign policy decisions and actions. This includes aspects like the type of government, political culture, and domestic actors like bureaucracies.

### Type of Government

The type of government a country has affects how foreign policy decisions are made. In authoritarian governments, the leader often has absolute power over foreign policy. Democratic governments tend to have more diverse inputs, oversight, and constraints on executive power over foreign policy. Parliamentary systems allow for faster policy changes while presidential systems generally promote more continuity.

### Political Culture

A country's history, values, ideology, and beliefs shape its political culture and outlook on international relations. Political culture helps determine what foreign policy goals and actions are seen as legitimate or acceptable. For example, pacifist cultures are less likely to support military interventions.

### Bureaucracies

Government agencies and bureaucracies are important actors in foreign policymaking. They provide intelligence, analysis, options, and implementation plans to leaders. Larger bureaucracies can develop institutional cultures and capabilities that shape what policy options get priority. Competing bureaucracies can lead to rivalries over policy.

## System-Level Analysis

System-level analysis focuses on the external constraints on foreign policy that arise from the structure of the international system. Countries do not make foreign policy decisions in a vacuum - they must account for systemic factors like power dynamics, economic realities, and international norms.

**Power Relationships**

The distribution of power in the international system affects foreign policy decision-making. The number of great powers and how they relate to one another is important. A multipolar system with several powerful actors creates different constraints than a bipolar system with two superpowers or a unipolar system with one hegemon. The global and regional context of power also matters.

**Economic Realities**

Economic interdependence between states and relative gains/losses factor into foreign policy calculations. Seeking absolute economic gains is often tempered by concerns over relative gains compared to other states. Economic sanctions and incentives are tools used to influence foreign policy behavior.

**International Norms**

Prevailing norms and expectations around issues like human rights, non-intervention, and weapons non-proliferation shape foreign policy options. Reputation and credibility matter when states consider adhering to or violating international norms. Norms evolve over time and state actions can modify norms.

## Case Study: The Vietnam War

The Vietnam War presents an interesting case study for foreign policy analysis. The war lasted from 1955 to 1975, with direct U.S. involvement from 1965 to 1973. There are several key factors that influenced U.S. foreign policy decisions during this time:

**Individual Level**

- President Lyndon B. Johnson's personality and leadership style impacted his decisions to escalate and continue the war. As an ambitious politician, he felt pressure not to be the first president to "lose a war."
- Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara pushed for the use of statistical analysis and "metrics" to measure success in Vietnam. This focus on data versus reality on the ground contributed to continued involvement.
- Cognitive biases and the " anchoring effect" caused leaders to stick with their initial assessments that victory could be achieved.

**State Level**

- The organizational bureaucracy of the military and defense departments enabled continuation of failed policies. Dissenting perspectives were pushed aside.
- Congress initially gave broad war powers to the President without oversight, enabling unilateral decision making.

**System Level**

- The Cold War environment and containment policy led to the view that loss in Vietnam meant loss of credibility globally.
- Domino theory exaggerated risks of communism spreading across Southeast Asia.

In summary, the complex foreign policy decisions during the Vietnam War can be analyzed through the three levels of FPA theory. Cognitive biases, individual beliefs, organizational factors, and the Cold War system all combined to shape the tragic decisions made by U.S. leaders.
