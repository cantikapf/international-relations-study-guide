# On the Brink of the Second World War

Notes: World War II was the deadliest global military conflict in history. Lasting from 1939 to 1945, the war engulfed over 30 countries and resulted in between 50 to over 80 million fatalities. Adolf Hitler’s invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939 officially started the war in Europe. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later. The fighting soon expanded to include much of Europe, North Africa, and Asia. By the time the war ended in 1945, it directly involved more than 100 million military personnel, including the armies, navies, and air forces of the major powers.

In addition to armed forces, World War II heavily relied on other resources like industrial power, financing, and scientific capabilities of nations. New technologies profoundly shaped tactics and strategy. German forces pioneered the use of Blitzkrieg (“lightning war”) that emphasized speed and surprise. Allied and Axis powers alike engaged in strategic bombing campaigns that targeted civilian and industrial sites. Chemical weapons were employed as well as nuclear ones, with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki effectively ending the war in the Pacific.

The key Allied Powers included **Britain, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and China**. The Axis Powers, led by **Germany, Italy, and Japan**, sought territorial expansion and to redress what they saw as unfair post-World War I treaties. Much of continental Europe quickly fell under Nazi Germany's control, while Imperial Japan gained significant ground in East Asia. The tide turned after the Allies achieved victories against Italy and Germany's key ally Japan in 1943. By early 1945, Allied forces had reclaimed most of the territories seized by Axis countries. On May 8, 1945, the Allies formally accepted Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender, marking the end of the war in Europe. Japan surrendered on September 2, 1945 following the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

World War II reshaped political and ethnic boundaries globally and ushered in the Cold War era. Its immense destruction and loss of life traumatized generations. The moral issues raised by the Holocaust, use of atomic weapons, war crimes, and civilian bombings sparked intense debate. Yet, the war also led to collective security through the United Nations, modern human rights concepts, and movements to prevent future genocide.

# Unresolved Issues from WWI

- The unresolved issues stemming from the **Treaty of Versailles** after World War I were a major contributing factor to the outbreak of World War II. Germany in particular harbored deep resentment over the harsh terms of the treaty, which required the country to accept full responsibility for causing the war. 

- The Treaty of Versailles forced Germany to **pay heavy financial reparations**, **give up territory**, and **limit its military strength**. These punitive measures left many Germans feeling humiliated. Political parties like the Nazis were able to exploit this widespread bitterness by promising to overturn the treaty and restore Germany's national pride.

- **Adolf Hitler frequently railed against the Treaty of Versailles in his speeches, using it to stoke nationalism and anti-Allied sentiments among the German public**. When Hitler rose to power in the 1930s, he began systematically dismantling the treaty's constraints on German rearmament. This raised international tensions and fueled distrust between Germany and the Allied powers of France and Britain.

- Overall, the resentment and instability bred by the Treaty of Versailles created a volatile political climate in Germany that paved the way for the aggression displayed by Hitler's regime. By the late 1930s, the treaty was essentially defunct, having failed to produce a lasting peace. Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939 marked its final repudiation, plunging Europe back into war just two decades after the end of World War I.

# Rise of Authoritarian Regimes

<center> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_uk_6vfqwTA?si=vDtZ6xDKcXKwhXD2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>

The rise of authoritarian regimes in Italy and Germany played a major role in setting the stage for World War II. These regimes embraced ideologies and policies that emphasized extreme nationalism, militarism, and territorial expansionism. This aggressive posturing created an environment conducive to war in Europe.

Notes: In Italy, Benito Mussolini rose to power in 1922 as the leader of the Fascist party. Italian Fascism exalted the nation state and promoted the supremacy of Italy in the Mediterranean region. Mussolini consolidated his dictatorship through intimidation and repression of political opponents. He forged a cult of personality and surrounded himself with Fascist loyalists. 

Mussolini pursued an imperialist foreign policy, exemplified by the invasion and conquest of Ethiopia in 1935. He enacted economic policies that aimed to make Italy self-sufficient and militarily strong. The Fascist regime tried to mobilize the masses through propaganda and pageantry. Ultimately, Mussolini’s territorial ambitions aligned with those of Nazi Germany leading up to World War II.

In Germany, Adolf Hitler became chancellor in 1933 and swiftly established a totalitarian dictatorship. Hitler's Nazi regime was predicated on tenets of racial supremacy, lebensraum (“living space”), and anti-Semitism. The Nazis suppressed dissent, purged political rivals, and created a pervasive police state.

Hitler exploited lingering bitterness over the Treaty of Versailles and widespread economic insecurity to galvanize support. He escalated Germany’s rearmament in open defiance of the treaty's constraints. Hitler laid claim to nearby territories with ethnic German populations, annexing Austria and the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia in 1938-1939. The Nazi regime's hunger for conquest was a driving factor behind the invasion of Poland in September 1939, marking the start of World War II.

# Territorial Ambitions

<center> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fo2Rb9h788s?si=nr1giDe6NlObvYyl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>

During the 1930s, expansionist territorial ambitions by fascist regimes in Italy and Germany significantly contributed to the start of World War II. These regimes emphasized aggressive nationalism and sought to extend their borders and spheres of influence. 

Notes:  In 1935, Mussolini's fascist Italy invaded Ethiopia in East Africa. Though the Ethiopians resisted, they were ultimately overpowered by Italy's modern weaponry including tanks and bombers. This demonstrated Italy's territorial ambitions under fascism and imperialist quest to control more land in Africa. Ethiopia was forced to surrender in 1936.

Meanwhile, Hitler and the Nazi party promoted the concept of Lebensraum or "living space" which called for expanding German territory eastward into Eastern Europe and Russia. Hitler argued this additional territory was required for the growth of the German population. The need for Lebensraum was used to justify military aggression and invasions.

Most significantly, Germany's invasion of neighboring Poland in September 1939 marked the start of World War II in Europe. The Nazis justified this by the need to reunite German territories separated after World War I. However, the invasion demonstrated the expansionist vision of Hitler and Nazi Germany's willingness to use military action to acquire more territory. This aggressive territorial ambition was a major precursor to the outbreak of the global conflict.

# Failure of the League of Nations

The League of Nations, established after World War I, failed in its goal to maintain world peace and prevent future global military conflict. There were several key reasons the League was unable to prevent the outbreak of World War II:

- **Lack of enforcement power** - The League had no standing army and relied on member states for military support. However, the League had no authority to force states to take action against aggressors. This made the League dependent on the political will of members.

- **Rise of aggressive authoritarian regimes** - The League was powerless in the face of militaristic regimes in Germany, Italy and Japan. Leaders like Hitler and Mussolini ignored the League as they pursued territorial ambitions. The League could not compel them to act otherwise.

- **Reluctance of major powers** - Major powers like Britain, France and the US were reluctant to commit to collective security actions, undermining the League's authority. Their self-interest and isolationism precluded decisive action.

- **Policy of appeasement** - Rather than stand up to acts of aggression, the League members pursued appeasement of expansionist regimes. Hitler's demands were accepted in hopes of avoiding all-out war. But this approach failed to restrain aggression.

Notes: The failure of the League of Nations to halt military aggressions in the 1930s allowed tensions to escalate into global conflict. By not enforcing its decisions with unified determination, the League was powerless to prevent the onset of the deadliest war in human history.

# Policy of Appeasement

The policy of appeasement, most notably implemented by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, was a major factor leading to World War II. Chamberlain strongly believed war needed to be avoided at all costs and that concessions to Hitler's demands were a necessary evil that would satisfy Germany's grievances from World War I and prevent further aggression.

In 1938, Chamberlain negotiated the Munich Agreement, which allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia. Hitler had demanded this area be given to Germany, claiming that the German-speaking population there was being mistreated. Chamberlain viewed appeasement as the only way to avoid another disastrous war. The Munich Agreement included Britain, France, Italy, and Germany - without any Czechoslovakian representation. 

Chamberlain returned to Britain declaring he had secured "peace for our time," but the Munich Agreement only emboldened Hitler. Within six months, Hitler broke the pact and occupied the remainder of Czechoslovakia. It became clear that appeasement had failed completely. Hitler's territorial ambitions could not be satisfied through concessions and his true aim was aggressive expansion, no matter the cost.

The policy of appeasement demonstrated the ineffectiveness of sacrificing principles to placate authoritarian regimes. Far from preventing war, appeasement allowed Germany, Italy, and Japan to pursue their militaristic goals unchecked right up until the outbreak of World War II.

# Rise of Adolf Hitler

The rise of Adolf Hitler as leader of Nazi Germany was a pivotal factor leading to World War II in Europe. Hitler gained power during a period of political and economic turmoil following Germany's defeat in World War I. 

Notes: Hitler was a skilled orator and propagandist, exploiting the climate of postwar humiliation, resentment, and economic depression. By scapegoating Jews and promising to restore German greatness, Hitler galvanized support and ascended through the ranks of the Nazi Party.

Once in power, Hitler dismantled the democratic Weimar Republic and transformed Germany into a one-party totalitarian state. He propagated the racist ideology of Nazism, calling for Aryan racial purity and expansion of German Lebensraum or "living space". 

Hitler enacted discriminatory laws against Jews, limited personal liberties, censored arts and media, and purged his political opponents in the Night of the Long Knives. He withdrew Germany from the League of Nations in 1933.

# Rise of Adolf Hitler

Hitler played on the German public's lingering outrage over post-WWI sanctions and humiliations like the Treaty of Versailles. By portraying himself as Germany's savior, he won widespread support.

Notes: Unemployment exceeded 6 million when the Great Depression hit Germany in 1929. Hitler promised jobs through huge public works programs and military spending. This resonated with struggling workers and businesses.

Through demagoguery, cunning manipulation of the masses, and shrewd use of propaganda, Hitler positioned himself as the strong leader Germany yearned for. This directly paved the path to WWII in Europe.

# Invasion of Poland

<center> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x0APrdY0G3k?si=sr85P5j_GTviNUH9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>

The actual start of World War II is marked by Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. This event came after months of escalating tensions and territorial demands made by Hitler. When Poland refused to concede any territory to Germany, Hitler put into motion his plans for an invasion using a new style of warfare called Blitzkrieg or "lightning war". 

Notes: The Blitzkrieg tactics involved coordinated attacks by fast-moving ground troops, tanks, and aircraft. These mobile forces would penetrate enemy lines and strike quickly at rear areas before defenders could react. Air strikes and bombing would devastate targets and infrastructure ahead of ground forces. Radio communications allowed ground troops and aircraft to coordinate. This combination of speed, mobility, and air power made the Blitzkrieg highly effective in overwhelming conventional defensive positions.

Against Poland, the Blitzkrieg was unleashed to devastating effect. 1.5 million German troops stormed over the Polish border, supported by tanks and 2,000 aircraft. The Luftwaffe bombed Polish cities and troops, destroying roads and railroads to hamper Polish movements. Panzer tank divisions punched through Polish defenses. The Polish army, though brave, was simply overwhelmed by Germany's concentrated firepower and mobility. Within a month, despite some determined counterattacks by Polish forces, Germany had occupied western Poland and surrounded the capital Warsaw.

The invasion of Poland represents a crucial turning point in the start of World War II. Hitler's use of the new Blitzkrieg tactics provided a blueprint for Germany's successful invasions of other neighbors, at least in the early phase of the war. The fall of Poland also marked the failure of British and French attempts at deterrence diplomacy. Within days of the invasion, they declared war on Germany, though they had no immediate plans to directly aid Poland.

# Conclusion

Notes: World War II served as a watershed moment in world history, ultimately reshaping global politics and economics for decades to follow. The path to this catastrophic conflict was paved by a multitude of complex factors across the international landscape during the first half of the 20th century. 

The unresolved political and economic issues stemming from World War I set the stage for simmering resentments and tensions between nations that would eventually boil over. The harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles imposed on Germany fostered feelings of victimization and humiliation that leaders like Hitler expertly exploited. 

The rise of totalitarian and fascist governments built on ideologies of extreme nationalism, racism, and militarism was a driving force behind the looming conflict. The aggressive expansionist and irredentist ambitions of leaders like Hitler and Hirohito, left unchecked by international bodies like the League of Nations, paved the way for military invasions and annexations of neighboring territories.

Appeasement policies aimed at avoiding another large-scale war by acquiescing to the demands of expansionist powers ultimately failed, as concessions only led to emboldened aggression. The policy of isolationism adopted by some nations also allowed tensions to intensify unchecked across Europe and Asia.

In the end, World War II was the destructive culmination of multiple complex factors - unresolved postwar grievances, economic turmoil, extreme ideologies, appeasement, and unchecked aggression between nations. The scale and impact of the ensuing global conflict would permanently alter the world order and shape international relations for decades to follow.
