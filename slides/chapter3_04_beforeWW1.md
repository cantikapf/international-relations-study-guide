# The Road to the First World War

Notes: The path to World War I was paved by a complex web of factors that turned a regional dispute in the Balkans into a global conflagration. Alliances, imperialism, militarism, nationalism, and industrialization all contributed to the tensions that exploded into full-scale war in 1914. The crisscrossing nature of European alliances meant that the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo triggered a domino effect, with the major powers drawn into the war through the defense pacts they had signed. The Great Powers of Europe, including Britain, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia, had been preparing for a large-scale war for years through massive military buildups and aggressive foreign policies aimed at expanding their colonial empires. The cultivation of strident nationalism by political elites further ratcheted up tensions between countries and created a population eager for war. New technologies like the machine gun and railroad heightened confidence in offensive battlefield strategies. Ultimately, the combination of these complex factors created a powder keg in Europe that was ignited by the spark of an assassination in 1914.

# Alliances

- Alliances bound European nations in complex webs of agreements in the early 20th century. The two major opposing alliances were the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance. 

- The Triple Entente consisted of Russia, France, and Britain. Russia aligned with France out of a mutual distrust and history of conflict with Germany and Austria-Hungary. Britain later joined to counter rising German naval power. The Triple Entente pledged support to each other if attacked.

# Alliances

- The Triple Alliance consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. Bismarck originally established this alliance to isolate France diplomatically after the Franco-Prussian war. Italy was promised territorial gains from Austria-Hungary to secure their participation. However, Italy left the Triple Alliance in 1914 due to disputes over territory.

- Tensions escalated as the alliances turned into rival blocs. When Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia after the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, it triggered a domino effect of military mobilizations and declarations of war within the alliances. Russia mobilized to support Serbia, Germany declared war on Russia, and France was brought into the war based on their alliance with Russia. The complex web of alliances was a major factor leading to the outbreak of the first global war.

- Intense competition between European nations fueled imperialism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This was characterized by the aggressive pursuit and acquisition of colonies, particularly by major powers like Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Belgium. 

---

# Imperialism

- Colonies provided imperialist countries access to raw materials, new markets for manufactured goods, and opportunities for investment. The "Scramble for Africa" is illustrative, as European powers carved up the continent into areas of control and exploitation. By 1900, 10% of Africa was under European control - by 1914 it had jumped to 90%.

- There was prestige associated with amassing colonies as well. expanding one's empire signaled national vitality and status on the global stage. As the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires declined, new powers like Italy and Germany sought to assert themselves by acquiring colonial territories. 

- Colonization was often justified via Social Darwinism and racist ideologies positing inherent European superiority over indigenous peoples. But competition between European powers for land and resources fostered tensions and rivalries. Disputes over control of colonies, especially in Africa, contributed to the complex web of grievances that helped spark World War I. Clearly imperialism, though motivated by economic and nationalist factors, carried a heavy price.

# Militarism Fuels the Arms Race

In the late 19th and early 20th century, militarism emerged as a powerful force across Europe. Militarism refers to the tendency of nations to buildup strong military capabilities and readiness to use war to achieve political aims and expand national power. 

Several factors contributed to the rise of militarism in the years leading up to World War I. As nationalist sentiment grew, countries sought to increase their military might and project an image of strength both domestically and internationally. The intense competition between great powers like Britain and Germany led both nations to rapidly expand their armies and navies. By 1914, Germany had the largest standing army in Europe. Russia also doubled the size of its army between 1870 and 1914 in an effort to modernize and exert greater influence.

The resulting arms race amplified tensions and mistrust between nations. Each country tried to outpace the military growth of potential adversaries. France increased the length of mandatory military service from 2 to 3 years in order to keep pace with Germany's swelling ranks. Britain made substantial naval investments to maintain its domination of the seas, while Germany raced to expand its naval capabilities and ship production. This competition between the British and German navies was a major source of antagonism in the years prior to the war.  

Notes: The geopolitical landscape was therefore shaped by the growing militarization across Europe. The buildup of offensive forces, rise in military expenditures, and pursuit of strategic advantages through arms escalation increased the likelihood of a military confrontation. The intense and unstable environment bred by militarism set the stage for the devastating global conflict that followed.

# Pride, Independence, and Nationalism

Nationalism, characterized by a strong sense of pride for one's country and desire for independence, was a major factor leading up to World War I. As European empires continued expanding their reach globally, many ethnic groups under imperial rule began seeking autonomy. 

This growing nationalism fueled independence movements and led to conflicts between ethnic groups and their imperial rulers. For example, as the Austro-Hungarian Empire grew, annexing territories like Bosnia-Herzegovina, nationalist sentiments surged within Slavic groups seeking self-determination. 

The desire for independent nation-states among ethnic groups in direct opposition to imperialist pursuits was a powder keg ready to explode. This nationalist zeal to throw off imperial control and establish sovereign states played a significant role in the tensions preceding World War I.

# Pride, Independence, and Nationalism

Key factors highlighting the role of nationalism include:

- The unification and rise of Germany fanned intense nationalist pride. Germany sought to assert itself and rival other European powers.

- In Russia, pan-Slavism gained traction, positioning Russia as the defender of Slavic peoples against Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman control. 

- Italy's late unification fueled nationalist ambitions to acquire Italian-speaking territories under Austria-Hungary's control. 

- Within Austria-Hungary, the empire struggled to placate nationalist movements from ethnic groups like Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, and Southern Slavs seeking self-governance.

- The Balkans remained a hotbed of nationalist unrest against Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian authority, with the desire for South Slavic unification.

Notes: As disparate ethnic groups demanded national self-determination, the stage was set for conflict between empires seeking to maintain dominance over territories clamoring for independence. This precarious landscape of surging nationalism and colliding imperial aims played a pivotal role in the origins of the First World War.

# Assassination of Archduke

The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the immediate trigger that led to the outbreak of World War I. On June 28, 1914, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, was visiting Sarajevo with his wife Sophie. During their procession through the city, Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip shot and killed both the Archduke and Sophie. 

Princip was part of a secret Serbian nationalist group called the Black Hand that wanted Bosnia to become part of Serbia. Bosnia had a large Serb population and had historically been under Serbian control, but had recently been annexed by Austria-Hungary. This angered Serbian nationalists who saw it as a threat to a Greater Serbia. 

The assassination set off a rapid chain of events, with Austria-Hungary quickly blaming Serbia for the attack. On July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. This caused Russia, an ally of Serbia, to begin mobilization of its forces. Germany then declared war on Russia. Based on interlocking alliances, soon all the major powers of Europe were drawn into the expanding conflict that marked the start of the First World War.

The killing of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne was the spark that unleashed these tensions between rival powers and set the stage for a devastating war on a scale never seen before in human history. The assassination revealed the instability created by militarism, imperialism, nationalism and a complex web of alliances in early 20th century Europe.

# Declarations of War Mark Formal Beginning

The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the trigger that led to the start of the First World War. In response to the assassination, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on July 28, 1914. This declaration drew in Germany, Russia, France, and Britain due to the intricate web of alliances that had been established.

Germany declared war on Russia on August 1, 1914 to support its ally Austria-Hungary. Russia had pledged to protect Serbia from Austria-Hungary. On August 3, Germany declared war on France, aiming for a quick victory by invading through neutral Belgium. Britain entered the war on August 4, 1914 due to being allied with France and Russia. 

These declarations of war by the major powers marked the formal beginning of World War I, with Germany and Austria-Hungary on one side, and France, Russia, and Britain on the other. The Central Powers and Triple Entente were now locked in a massive global conflict that would last over four years and result in unprecedented loss of life and destruction across Europe and beyond.

# Invasion of Belgium

The war began on August 4, 1914, when Germany invaded neutral Belgium as part of its wider plan to attack France by outflanking its defenses along the French-German border. The German invasion of Belgium, known as The Rape of Belgium, violated Belgium's neutrality, which had been guaranteed by the Treaty of London in 1839. Though Belgium had declared its neutrality and intended to defend it, its small military was vastly outmatched by the larger German force. 

The German High Command justified the invasion as a matter of military necessity, asserting it did not intend to annex Belgian territory but rather use it as a route into France. They also accused Belgium of being more favorably inclined toward the Triple Entente. However, the German invasion outraged public opinion and helped galvanize British support for entering the war. The day after the invasion, Britain sent Germany an ultimatum to withdraw from Belgium, which was ignored. Britain then declared war on Germany on August 4, marking its official entry into World War I. 

Over the next few weeks, the German army advanced through Belgium, occupying Brussels by August 20, 1914. They met stiff Belgian resistance, including at the Battle of Liège, but the small and outdated Belgian army was unable to halt the German offensive. Stories of German atrocities against Belgian civilians, such as massacring civilians and burning villages, emerged during this invasion, later known as "The Rape of Belgium."

# US Neutrality

Although World War I began in Europe, it eventually spread globally, forcing the previously neutral United States to declare its stance. When Austria-Hungary officially declared war against Serbia on July 28, 1914, a domino effect of war declarations followed over the next several days and weeks between the alliance members. 

The United States, under President Woodrow Wilson, made an official declaration of neutrality on August 4, 1914. This declaration from Wilson stated that the U.S. would remain impartial in action and thought toward the belligerents and avoid all actions or policies that would favor any one power. Wilson urged Americans to be neutral in conduct and judgment to avoid embroiling the nation into the European conflict.

The Neutrality Proclamation also asked U.S. citizens to refrain from taking part in aiding any belligerent nation. Despite the intention of remaining officially neutral, the U.S. did continue trade with both sides early in the war. Over time, however, British naval blockades severely hampered trade with Germany and stoked tensions between the U.S. and Germany over freedom of the seas.

Although neutral at the start, the U.S. eventually entered World War I in 1917 on the side of the Allies after repeated German provocations and the infamous Zimmerman Telegram. America's initial neutrality was short-lived due to the global nature of the conflict.

# Conclusion

Notes: The outbreak of World War I can be attributed to a complex interplay of factors that had been simmering beneath the surface of early 20th century Europe. Key among these were the rise of nationalist movements, the web of alliances between major powers, imperialistic expansion, and an escalating arms race. 

With the fervent spread of nationalism, ethnic groups sought autonomy from multinational empires. This fervor was met with resistance from imperial rulers, creating friction. At the same time, major European powers had divided themselves into opposing diplomatic blocs through a series of mutual defense alliances. Meanwhile, imperial competition led nations to build up their militaries and expand their colonial reach. 

The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand became the immediate trigger that ignited these interconnected tensions. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, backed by Germany. Russia came to Serbia's defense based on Slavic ties and their own conflict with Austria-Hungary. France and Britain entered based on their alignments. 

Within weeks, the major powers of Europe were drawn into a massive conflict as a result of their imperial ambitions, military escalations, nationalist movements, and complex web of alliances. The Great War had begun, fueled by this mixture of long-building and immediate factors. Its outcome and aftermath would dramatically reshape Europe and the world.
