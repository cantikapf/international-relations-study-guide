- Social science is the name given to our knowledge about the nature, growth, and functioning of human society.
- In contrast to the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics) which focus primarily on natural phenomena (stem cells, molecules, light waves), the subject of social science is society itself.
-  Social scientists use empirical research methods to investigate all sorts of interpersonal and intrapersonal behavior, from why people fall in love to why people commit crimes.

Notes: Social science is the collective body of knowledge that explores the nature, growth, and functioning of human society. Unlike the natural sciences that focus on phenomena such as stem cells and light waves, social science delves into the intricate workings of society itself, utilizing social and behavioral explanations to comprehend the complex tapestry of human interactions.

# The Scope of Social Sciences

What is empirical research? Empirical research in international relations is based on observed and measured phenomena and derives knowledge from actual experience rather than from theory or speculation. For example, the examination of relationship between foreign aid and conflict in developing countries; IR scholar study the case that already happened rather than speculating something that has not been happened

Notes: Social scientists employ empirical research methods to investigate interpersonal and intrapersonal behaviors, ranging from the dynamics of falling in love to the motivations behind criminal activities. Empirical research, as a cornerstone of international relations, draws knowledge from observed and measured phenomena, providing insights derived from actual experiences rather than theoretical speculation.

# The Focus of Social Sciences

- Change in human relationship and reinterpretation between the present and past events. 
- Human activities and spatial distributions an interaction of culture, biological and physical elements. 
- Basic social systems, institutions and recesses. 
- Relationships between individual and institutions; and among political economic and social institutions. 
- The nature of societies and authors; and the interactions of people with each other and also their social and physical environment. 

Notes: The study of social science involves a nuanced exploration of human relationships, the reinterpretation of past events, and the interplay of cultural, biological, and physical elements. Examining basic social systems, institutions, and processes, social scientists scrutinize relationships between individuals and institutions, as well as the intricate connections among political, economic, and social entities.

# Origin of the Term 'Social Science'

- At the beginning of the 19th century, social science had attained in all the leading European countries a firm and respectable position. 
- In the 20th century we can also observe recurrent occasions when proposals for a generalized social science were made.
- Auguste Comte influenced social scientist such as Emile Durkheim and Karl Marx.
- Lawrence A. Kempton in his article “Social Sciences Today” states that social science as science is very young and there is confusion with regards to its limits and boundaries.

Notes: As the 19th century dawned, social science secured a firm and respectable position across leading European countries. Figures like Auguste Comte influenced subsequent luminaries such as Emile Durkheim and Karl Marx. Despite its historical roots, social science is a relatively young science, with ongoing debates about its limits and boundaries, as noted by Lawrence A. Kempton in "Social Sciences Today."

# Scientific Methods and Applications

- **Conditions Favorable to Scientific Inquiry**: Scientific inquiry is possible only in a society in which certain attitudes are developed or tolerated.
- **Nature of the Scientific Method**: Science is based on the assumption that this is an orderly universe, ruled by the law of cause and effect
- **The Experimental Method and Its Limitations**: Scientist cannot control the situations that are significant for the solution of problems, unlike experiment in the laboratory.

Notes: Scientific inquiry in social science requires a society with developed or tolerated attitudes conducive to research. Grounded in the assumption of an orderly universe governed by cause and effect, the scientific method explores the conditions favorable to scientific inquiry and delves into the experimental method, acknowledging its inherent limitations.

# Research Stages in Social Sciences

1. Observe.
2. Define the problem. 
3. Review the literature. (Become familiar with what others have observed.) 
4. Observe some more.
5. Develop a theoretical framework and formulate a hypothesis. 
6. Choose the research design.
7. Collect the necessary data.
8. Analyze the results.
9. Draw conclusions.

Notes: Social science research follows a systematic approach with stages such as observation, problem definition, literature review, theoretical framework development, hypothesis formulation, research design selection, data collection, results analysis, and conclusion drawing. This structured process ensures a rigorous and evidence-based exploration of social phenomena.

# Approaches and Methods in Social Science Research

- Alternatives Approaches
	- The functionalist theory approach.
	- The exchange theory approach.
	- The conflict theory approach.
	- The symbolic interaction theory approach.
- Alternative Methods
	- The historical method.
	- The case method. 
	- The comparative and cross-cultural methods.

>   An approach is a general term that encompasses the overall strategy or perspective used in a research project, while a method is a specific technique or tool used to gather and analyze data.

Notes: Social scientists adopt various approaches, such as functionalist, exchange theory, conflict theory, and symbolic interaction theory, each offering a unique perspective on research projects. Accompanying these approaches are methods like the historical method, case method, and comparative and cross-cultural methods, providing diverse tools to investigate and analyze social phenomena.

# Social Science and Society

Contrary to concerns about societal objectives, social scientists aim to discover how objectives can be achieved. Their role is to facilitate understanding, addressing issues, outlining difficulties, and proposing steps toward viable solutions.

# Three Major Perspectives of Sociology

- Functionalism
	- Society is viewed as a complex system of parts (structures) that interact to perform various necessary functions.
	- Shared values, norms, attitudes and beliefs (consensus). 
	- Change is generally viewed as disruptive and gradual.
- Conflict Theory
	- Views society as a struggle for resources and power
	- Change is inevitable, often beneficial and can be violent
	- Conflict between the classes determines social change
	- Some groups prosper at the expense of others
	- Conflict is universal; social consensus is limited and inequality is widespread
- Symbolic Interactionism
	- Studies society through interactions within individual and small groups
	- Interaction between individuals is negotiated through shared symbols, gestures  and nonverbal communications
	- Humans are social animals and require interaction
	- Asks the questions”  “How do individuals experience one another?” “How do they interpret the meaning of these interactions?” and “How do people construct a sense of self and the society as a whole?”

Notes: Within sociology, three major perspectives guide the analysis of societal structures. Functionalism views society as a complex system of interacting parts with shared values, norms, and gradual change. Conflict theory perceives society as a struggle for resources and power, emphasizing inevitable and often beneficial change. Symbolic interactionism studies society through individual and small group interactions, exploring the shared symbols and nonverbal communications that shape human experiences and the construction of identity.

# Conclusion

Notes: In conclusion, the realm of social science offers a multifaceted lens through which we can comprehend the intricacies of human society, bridging the gap between historical roots and contemporary challenges.
